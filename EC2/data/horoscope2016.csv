2016|1|1|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|1|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|1|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|1|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|1|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|1|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|1|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|1|1|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|1|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|1|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|1|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|1|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars

2016|1|6|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|1|7|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|7|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|7|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|7|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|7|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|7|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|7|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|1|7|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|7|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|7|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|7|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you.

2016|1|12|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|12|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|12|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|1|13|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|13|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|13|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|13|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|13|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|13|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|13|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|1|13|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|13|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

2016|1|18|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|18|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|18|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|18|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|18|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|1|19|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|19|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|19|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|19|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|19|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|19|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|19|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line.

2016|1|24|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|24|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|1|24|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|24|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|24|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|24|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|24|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|1|25|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|25|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|25|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|25|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|25|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars

2016|1|30|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|30|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|1|30|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|30|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|1|30|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|1|30|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|30|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|30|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|30|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|1|31|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|1|31|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|1|31|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is.

The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|5|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|5|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|5|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|5|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|5|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|2|5|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|5|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|5|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|5|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|5|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|2|6|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

2016|2|11|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|11|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|11|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|11|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|11|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|11|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|11|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|2|11|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|11|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|11|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|11|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|11|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces.

2016|2|16|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|16|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|2|17|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|17|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|17|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|17|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|17|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|17|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|17|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|2|17|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|17|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|22|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|22|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|22|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|22|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|2|23|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|23|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|23|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|23|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|23|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|23|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|23|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|2|23|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you.

2016|2|28|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|2|28|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|2|28|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|28|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|28|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|28|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|2|29|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|29|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|2|29|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|29|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|2|29|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|2|29|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation.

There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|3|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|3|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|3|3|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|3|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|3|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged.

2016|3|3|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|3|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces.

Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|4|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|4|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|4|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket.

2016|3|9|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|9|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|9|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|9|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|3|9|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|9|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|9|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|9|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|9|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|3|10|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|10|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|10|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is.

A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|15|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|15|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|15|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|15|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|15|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|3|15|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|15|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|15|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|15|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|15|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|3|16|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|3|21|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|21|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|21|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|21|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|21|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|21|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|21|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|3|21|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|21|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|21|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|21|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars

2016|3|26|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|26|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|26|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|3|27|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|27|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|3|27|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|27|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|3|27|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|3|27|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|27|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|3|27|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|3|27|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best.

2016|4|1|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|1|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|1|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|1|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|1|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|4|2|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|2|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|2|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|2|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|2|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|2|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|2|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door.

Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|7|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|4|7|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|7|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|7|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|7|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|7|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|4|8|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|8|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|8|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|8|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|8|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars

2016|4|13|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|13|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|13|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|4|13|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|13|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|13|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|13|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|13|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|4|14|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|14|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|14|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|14|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket.

2016|4|19|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|19|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|19|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|19|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|19|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|4|19|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|19|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|19|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|19|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|19|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|4|20|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|20|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars

2016|4|25|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|25|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|25|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|25|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|25|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|25|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|25|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|4|25|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|25|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|25|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|25|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|25|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces.

2016|4|30|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|30|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|4|31|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|31|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|4|31|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|31|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|4|31|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|4|31|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|31|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|4|31|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|4|31|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

2016|5|5|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|5|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|5|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|5|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|5|6|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|6|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|6|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|6|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|6|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|6|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|6|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|5|6|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old.

If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|5|11|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|11|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|11|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|11|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|11|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|5|12|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|12|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|12|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|12|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|12|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|12|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars

There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|17|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|17|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|5|17|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|17|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|17|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|17|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|17|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|5|18|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|18|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|18|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|18|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars

What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|23|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|23|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|23|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|23|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|5|23|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|23|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|23|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|23|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|23|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|5|24|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|24|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars

2016|5|29|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|29|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|29|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|29|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|29|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|5|29|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|29|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|5|29|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|5|29|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|5|29|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|29|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|5|29|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces.

Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|3|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|6|4|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|4|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|4|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|4|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|4|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|4|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|4|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|6|4|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|4|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|4|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged.

Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|9|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|9|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|9|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|6|10|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|10|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|10|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|10|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|10|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|10|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|10|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|6|10|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars

View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|6|15|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|15|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|15|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|15|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|15|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|6|16|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|16|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|16|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|16|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|16|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|16|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words.

There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|21|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|21|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|6|21|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|21|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|21|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|21|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|21|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|6|22|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|22|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|22|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|22|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars

What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|27|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|27|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|6|27|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|27|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|6|27|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|6|27|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|27|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|27|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|6|27|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|6|28|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|6|28|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars

Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|2|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|2|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|2|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|2|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|2|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|2|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|2|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|2|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|2|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|2|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|2|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars

2016|7|7|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|8|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|8|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|8|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|8|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|8|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|8|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|8|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|8|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|8|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|8|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|8|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars

2016|7|13|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|13|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|13|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|14|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|14|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|14|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|14|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|14|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|14|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|14|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|14|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|14|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars

2016|7|19|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|19|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|19|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|19|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|19|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|20|1|Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aries. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|20|2|You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Taurus. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|20|3|A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|20|4|You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Cancer. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|20|5|Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Leo. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|20|6|Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, Virgo. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|20|7|If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Libra, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|20|8|Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|20|9|You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Sagittarius. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|20|10|Unexpected events could shuffle the cards when you least expect it, Capricorn. If you haven't kept a close eye on the deck, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is playing under the same rules as you. If the dealer seems crooked, go to another table. Don't fall victim to the same trick twice.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|20|11|Your sense of self may be challenged today, Aquarius, and you might have trouble keeping your seat during the joust. Keep in mind that the way others see you isn't necessarily the way you are. Don't feel like you have to change direction to please anyone. Your only responsibility is to you. Bizarre events may occur, urging you to change your thinking.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|20|12|As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Pisces. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|21|1|Business and financial matters look promising today, Aries, but you could find yourself torn between the need to attend to these matters and the desire to relax at home. If you have to make a choice, it might be best to choose the former, because today's aspects promise opportunities that might not come around again for a while. The evening should be your own. Plan an intimate dinner with a lover. You'll like the results!|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|21|2|Today, Taurus, matters surrounding business and finances need immediate attention, and this could prove a bit disheartening. Do you have a lot of unfinished tasks that have piled up? Gear up and get to them. They aren't going away, and you'll feel better about everything when they're out of the way. You might find that clearing up these old matters allows new opportunities to flow your way.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|21|3|New opportunities to advance your professional standing may arise, Gemini. The aspects bode well for business and money. Promising new projects may present themselves. Your tendency to serve and nurture others should strengthen your work relationships, so morale on the job takes a tangible upswing at this time. Warmth and affection for friends, children, romantic partners, and even casual acquaintances should increase and enhance relationships.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|21|4|Restlessness may plague you throughout the day, Cancer, because you could be brimming over with physical energy but have no outlet for it. You might have to stay in and wait for something important, which could prove frustrating. Put on an exercise video and do aerobics while you wait. This isn't a good day to start new projects. Limit your social interactions to exercising with others at the gym.|Taurus|Scorpio|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|21|5|Though current business and money matters could well encounter obstacles, at this time you may find yourself reaping the rewards of past efforts. Your naturally persevering nature practically assures more success in the future, Leo, even though you might be blocked now. New insights as to how to continue to progress could come your way today. It might be a good idea to write them down so you'll be assured of having them at your fingertips later.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|21|6|Today your powers of persuasion are at an all-time high. This is a good day to ask for a raise or promote a new project. Your drive to gain recognition for your accomplishments may necessitate seeking the public eye, so if publicity is what you need, this is the day to go for it. Your observational skills are acute, as is your insight into others' feelings. This is definitely a good day to seek advancement.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|21|7|This day bodes well for accomplishments in business and finance. Long-term investments of either time or funds may finally pay off. New opportunities could come your way. This is a better time to complete old projects than start new ones, Libra, but if you must, new projects started now should be successful. Celebrate by treating yourself to new clothes. Wear them for a longtime friend or lover this evening.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|21|8|Your insight, creativity, and inventiveness are in full swing, Scorpio, and new ideas come thick and fast. However, you might find yourself too caught up in boring, mundane tasks to do very much about it. Yet physical energy is plentiful, so you have it in you to take care of chores and then have time to do what you enjoy. You'll produce results if you remember to pace yourself. Work too hard and you'll be too tired!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|21|9|As a natural healer, you might find yourself experiencing a rush of transformative energy today, which you should put into practice. This is a great time to go for a massage or study natural healing modalities such as herbs or aromatherapy. Combine them with your innate healing abilities, Sagittarius, and you might be happy with the results. Your mind is especially receptive right now. You'll retain more of what you learn than you usually would.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|21|10|Be prepared to work diligently toward making your dreams a reality today, Capricorn. Success is definitely on the way, though it may not be approaching quite as quickly as you might like. A lot of significant letters and phone calls could come your way, keeping you busy. Don't allow yourself to get too frazzled, though. Take time periodically throughout the day to sit quietly and recoup your energy.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|21|11|You could find it harder than usual to wake up this morning, Aquarius, as your energy may be flagging. Personal or professional pressures might stir feelings of futility, but don't fall into this trap. In spite of your momentary lethargy, everything on the horizon looks far better than it seems - primarily because of your own hard work. Retire early tonight and tomorrow you'll feel more energetic.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|21|12|Today it might suddenly hit you that you have a lot of unfinished tasks that need to be completed, and this might lead to a case of the blues. Take heart! The process appears more overwhelming than it is, Pisces. A little planning and focused discipline should enable you to get through everything without stressing yourself out too much. In the evening, reward yourself with a meal out or a movie.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|22|1|Concentrate on nurturing your needs right now instead of trying to accommodate the needs of others, Aries. There is a difficult tension that arises when you try to comfort someone who really doesn't want to be comforted. The best way to handle the situation is to leave the person alone and tend to your own emotions. If you're more stable and clear, you'll be better able to help others. Take this time to recharge your own batteries.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|22|2|Things may roll along nicely in love and romance and then suddenly run into a snag, Taurus. Perhaps you failed to recognize an important birthday or anniversary. Perhaps you were expected to act a certain way or do something you failed to do. Approach the person you hurt honestly and apologetically. You write your own rules. Your way may differ from someone else's, but that doesn't make it better or worse.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|22|3|Here's a reminder that it's OK to be you. You may feel more centered than usual, which encourages you to stand up for yourself and say the things you must to people who need to hear them. There may have been recent arguments with a partner, but those should subside now, thanks to today's serene feelings. Perhaps you've gained greater insight into the cause of the tension. Share this with the person you've been arguing with.|Aries|Libra|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|22|4|You may have that awful feeling that you really need to get down to work yet something seems to stand square in the way of progress. Perhaps you feel like you're at a four-way stop with three other cars. Everyone is anxious to go first. You can't all go at once, yet no one knows whose turn it is. Don't put the pedal to the metal. Instead, ease slowly into the intersection and clearly signal your intentions.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|22|5|You're anxious to take action, Leo, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Be careful about acting too hastily. It's important that you and your loved one be on the same page first. You're probably ready to jump to the end of the book where everyone lives happily ever after. There's a whole story that has to play out first. Feel free to take aggressive action, but make sure that you temper it with a dash of common sense.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|22|6|It may feel as if something or someone is trying to keep you from moving ahead with your ambitious goals and aggressive nature, Virgo. At first you may resent this ball and chain attached to your ankle, but on closer examination, you'll see that this hindrance is actually a help. For now it's serving as an important reminder to slow down and do more thinking and planning before taking action.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|22|7|You're apt to feel more talkative than usual, Libra. There are many times when you may shrink from a situation in disgust or perhaps boredom. You're usually anxious to move from one scene and get on with the next. Feel free to call the shots and speak your mind. Others are more likely to listen to what you have to say, so be honest when someone comes to you with a question or situation that he or she needs help with.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|22|8|You may be anxious to try an uncharted path that speaks to your sense of risk and adventure, Scorpio. It's important to temper these actions with realistic planning. You're much more likely to get a flat tire when you don't carry a spare. Make sure you have the proper resources to pull yourself out of any jam along the way. The old way of doing things is practical, tested, and tried and true for a reason, so don't dismiss it altogether.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|22|9|Other people are likely to be anxious to get up and moving with their plans, Sagittarius. It might be better for you to hang back a bit and see how things pan out before you take action. Let others go across the river first to learn the best way. Do you take a boat, wade, or look for a bridge? Let someone else be the guinea pig so you'll have all the information you need to make the most prudent decision on how to proceed.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|22|10|Your heart has been active, Capricorn, and you're probably feeling the need to take charge of a certain relationship. Instead of being too hasty in your pursuit of this romance, you should probably do more planning. Look at the situation from a long-term perspective and see if the partnership is heading the way you want it to, based on how things are moving now. It could be that you're jumping ahead of the game.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|22|11|There is solid grounding to your emotions right now that is helping you stabilize your sensitive feelings, Aquarius. As you become more attuned to your internal needs, you may discover that recent actions in romance and love may not have been particularly appropriate. They could have seemed satisfying at the time, but on closer examination you may discover that you were compromising in order to make it seem like everything was working the way you wanted it to.|Scorpio|Aries|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|22|12|Your relationships are going well from an intellectual perspective, Pisces, but from an emotional one, you might feel like they aren't as fulfilling as you'd like. Perhaps you're letting your brain do too much of the driving. It's time to let your heart take over and have its needs be tended to for a while. As your energy shifts, so will that of people around you. Let them react however they will. Try not to be upset by the changes that follow.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|1|You may feel smothered by certain individuals and loved ones who hang on you like barnacles on a rock, Aries. You're a big part of their emotional support system and they rely on you for strength. Today, however, you could get frustrated by this extra weight. You'll more than likely want to rip those barnacles off in order to give you more breathing room. Freedom from others' emotional baggage is the key for today.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|2|You may end up scaring people with your dramatic, emotional outbursts, Taurus. Your behavior is likely to be erratic. The smallest things could set you off on a crazy tirade. The root of these issues probably has to do with a need to be loved, and you feel like others don't give you the attention you think you deserve. Try not to let your happiness depend so much on others' actions. The most important love is self-love.|Pisces|Virgo|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|23|3|You might surprise a few people with your words and actions, which could seem out of character for you, Gemini. Don't be surprised if you don't think or act like your normal self. There is a streak of the oddball inside you that wants to have its day in the spotlight. Let that part of you shine through by wearing your plaid pants with a polka dot shirt and furry orange hat. Wear bright, expressive colors that show off your willingness to stand out in a crowd.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|23|4|You could feel like a giant wrecking ball that's anxious to break down existing structures. Perhaps you're upset about a new development in your town, the country's political system, or the power structure within your home. Regardless of the exact reason, you're certain that change needs to happen in order to make progress. Often one must tear down an existing structure before a better one can be built.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|5|Keep pen and paper close by, Leo, and have the number of the patent office on hand. You're apt to come up with some original ideas that could be revolutionary. You're likely be more intrigued by gadgets and electronic devices than usual. You have the power to make cunning observations about how things work. You may end up with a brilliant idea on how to improve the efficiency of an appliance in your house.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|23|6|You may have endless ideas streaming through your head but little patience to see any of them through to the end, Virgo. Perhaps you're so busy jumping from one thought to the next that you don't take any of them far enough to know whether or not they're worth pursuing. Write thoughts down as they come to you, and go over them later when your mind is in a quieter state.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|7|It's OK to change your opinion, Libra. You may pride yourself on being the solid one who always has an answer or knows exactly where to go. You may look upon others as flaky, indecisive, or fickle. It's important that you not shut down your thinking after making a decision about something. Keep your mind open to changes that occur around you and maybe you'll have a change of heart.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|23|8|You may feel a strong need to express your individuality, Scorpio. You don't want to blend into the herd, unseen as you walk down the street. You want to be the sheep with the blue wool, the person skipping instead of walking. Find a place or group that lets you be yourself and not worry about what other people think about your style. Your originality is inspiring. Don't squelch it.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|23|9|Going with the flow may not necessarily appeal to you today, Sagittarius. This is one time when you may want to be the fish swimming upstream while the school heads downstream. Feel free to go your own way regardless of what others have to say about it. You may get pressured by your loved ones to act a certain way or go somewhere special. Don't do these things just to please them. Do what pleases you.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|23|10|There are a few emotional surprises coming your way, Capricorn. You might act a certain way under normal circumstances, but today you're apt to take a completely different route. Perhaps you don't know why you suddenly feel comfortable about a situation that you'd normally be quite skeptical about. Nevertheless, this feeling is possible. Don't bother questioning your emotions. Simply roll with whatever circumstances come your way. You'll open many doors for yourself.|Libra|Pisces|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|11|You're apt to need emotional freedom, Aquarius. Perhaps you sense that you're being coerced or manipulated into feeling a certain way and feel trapped in the situation. If you can distance yourself, you're likely to see that you're indeed getting caught up in someone else's drama. Right now it's imperative that you find an outlet where you can express yourself freely without feeling like you have to act a particular way.|Scorpio|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|23|12|Take inventory of your habits and behaviors, Pisces. Look to certain patterns and note the ones that do and don't work for you. You'll more than likely feel an urge to break free from repetition and create new paths that allow for other opportunities to come along. You may not even be consciously aware that in many ways you're beating a dead horse. Don't continue to waste your energy on paths that go nowhere.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|1|Today is an excellent day in which you should be able to ground your emotions and find a greater amount of stability in your life. As you walk down the street, be conscious of the Earth below you. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and realize that you're a living part and product of this great planet. Don't separate yourself from Mother Nature - you are her child. Respect her.|Aquarius|Leo|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|7|24|2|Realize that you're the one responsible for cleaning up your own mess, Taurus. If you've left your dirty clothes on the floor and the dishes unwashed, you will be the one who has to pay the consequences later on. Take responsibility for your actions. Today is an excellent day to do your laundry and clean the mess in the sink. You'll feel better about yourself and your immediate environment after you do.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|3|Things should be going your way right now, Gemini. Feel confident about yourself and your decisions. Let your inner glow radiate outward and show people that you have a great deal of love to offer. Practice what you preach. You lose respect when you act contrary to the way in which you insist the people around you act. Feel your power from within as opposed to trying to get it from others.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|24|4|Follow through on your promises today, Cancer. You may be generous with your words and advice, but you might fall a bit short when it comes to actually delivering the goods. This is a great time to prove to others that you mean what you say. Do the things that you said you would. You'll be able to accomplish quite a bit as long as you maintain a focused and positive mindset.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|5|Don't get discouraged by other people's failures today, Leo. There may be signs that warn you of potential roadblocks ahead, but this doesn't mean that you should turn your car around or give up on your goal. Perhaps you only need to slow down the pace or select a new route. Either way, you have the perseverance and inner drive to accomplish any task you undertake.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|24|6|Don't get thrown off your path, Virgo. Focus inward and concentrate on the tasks at hand. This may not be the most lighthearted and jovial day, but one must always take the good with the bad. Use the sober, grounding tone of today's energy to get down to business and stay there. Work now, play later! Remember the story about the ant and the grasshopper. Now is the time to store provisions for the future.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|7|Things should be flowing quite well for you today, Libra. Take this opportunity and use the energy to its full potential. Center yourself and look at the weeks ahead. Where do you want to be in two months? Where do you want to be in two years? Now is the time to take stock of what you've got and plan for future growth. You have a great deal going for you, so don't waste your time on frivolity.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|8|Today is a great day to gather data for a new project you're working on, Scorpio. Put your nose to the grindstone and make some major progress on an important job. Find comfort in your work. Make sure, however, that the work you're engaged in is something that feeds your soul as opposed to just put money in your pocket. This is critical to maintaining a healthy mind and spirit.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|24|9|It's obvious how much you like to dream, Sagittarius. Certainly, this is an important part of your existence. Realize that there comes a time when you must face reality. This is one of those days when you need to bite the bullet and deal with your bills. Take care of annoying errands that you've been putting off. Send the letters that have piled up on your desk for days. Stop making excuses.|Virgo|Aquarius|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|24|10|Stop wasting your energy on things that have no real relevance in your life, Capricorn. This is a day to focus your attention on the tasks at hand and get things done. Don't get distracted by the blinking neon lights. Stay tuned to your own channel. It might not be a bad idea to adopt more of a critical tone so you don't get caught up in issues that don't pertain to you.|Libra|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|24|11|Delight in all your projects today, Aquarius. You should enjoy a positive mood and pleasurable experiences with others. Let the good times roll. Your ego and emotions should be acting harmoniously. You have every reason to smile, so keep grinning from ear to ear. You're able to get a lot accomplished if you so choose. Adjust your compass, check the prevailing winds, and set sail.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|24|12|Today isn't a great day for inspiring enthusiasm in others, Pisces. You might find that there's a sober, conservative tone to the day that's stealing the fuel from your fire. Realize that this is just part of the natural cycle of things. Don't feel that you need to be up and active all the time. Give yourself a rest and focus your energy inward. Settle your nerves and get down to business.|Capricorn|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|25|1|Other people may try to wield their power even when it isn't their place. This is one time when people may try to show off their IQ by offering random facts that don't offer anything useful to the situation at hand but just serve to prove their knowledge of esoteric trivia. Try not to buy into other people's displays of power, Aries. There's more than likely a great deal of hype and not much substance.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|25|2|Once your brain gets hooked on something, Taurus, you're likely to take it to the extreme. Be careful of overworking yourself in a certain issue that requires a more rational, temperate attitude. You may get into trouble if you insist on going off the deep end. Don't tackle issues you aren't ready to handle. Take things slowly and maintain a moderate, conservative viewpoint. If you go too far, back off and take a break.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|25|3|Your brain is likely to be working overtime, Gemini. Things were going along just fine until you suddenly ran into an unexpected snag that kept you from where you want to be. It's as if the hamster wheel you've been running on suddenly jammed. Even though you're still working just as hard, the wheel simply won't turn. Perhaps it's time to step off and take a break. Get some perspective.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|25|4|Try not to get too wrapped up in the mental side of things, Cancer. Perhaps you're trying to work everything through in your mind. You'll find that there are strong forces outside your own trying their hardest to manipulate your thinking. It might be good to step away from the situation and do more processing with your heart. Go with your instincts rather than rely so much on your thoughts.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|25|5|It's possible that you've been so emotional about a certain issue that you've taken it way too far, Leo. Fortunately, your reasoning has finally caught up with your feelings. Now it's time for a reckoning. Give your brain a chance to sort things out and bring the situation back into equilibrium. Your first tendency may be to overreact and have things swing in the opposite direction. Do your best to resist this temptation.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|25|6|You may experience a transformation in your thinking. It's bound to affect every aspect of your life, Virgo. By always questioning, you work through difficult issues that require a constant reshuffling of viewpoints. Feel free to open yourself up to new ways of thinking as you dismiss old ways that no longer serve you. Now is a terrific time to consider a fresh wave of thought. You'll be exposed to a new way of truth.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|25|7|You may be overwhelmed by an onslaught of communication from someone you didn't expect to hear from, Libra. It could be that this person suddenly puts a monkey wrench in your plans. It's important to adapt and allow for the constant changes that are bound to come your way. Don't get so hung up on a certain way of doing things that you fail to see the wisdom in a new and different approach.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|25|8|Someone might feel obligated to give you their two cents even if you didn't ask for it, Scorpio. Be careful not to dismiss this information without giving it proper consideration. This knowledge comes to you for a reason, and it's possible that it's the very piece of information you need now in order to complete the puzzle. Don't disregard anything, regardless of how esoteric it seems.|Leo|Capricorn|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|25|9|It's time to finally apply the knowledge you've accumulated and come to recognize the truth, Sagittarius. Perhaps you've been sitting on the facts while contemplating their meaning. It's now time to get this information out into the open. There's no doubt that this action is likely to make waves, but that's OK. A key theme of the day is transformation, so feel free to contribute your part.|Virgo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|25|10|When it comes to issues that require real thinking, be careful of letting someone else take control. You might have a rather lazy attitude in this department, Capricorn, and it could be tempting to simply let someone else do the thinking for you. This attitude is apt to lead you down the wrong path for you. Taking responsibility for yourself means thinking for yourself, so do it.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|25|11|There's likely to be a powerful force at work trying to manipulate the way you think about a certain situation, Aquarius. Be conscious of the source of your facts. It could be that someone is giving you tainted information so you'll act in a way that is favorable to his or her plan. Others may not be looking out for your best interests, so it's important that you are. Don't accept things blindly without question.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|25|12|Don't second-guess yourself today, Pisces. It could be that you're wavering so much about a decision that even after you make it, you hesitate to follow through with it. Once you make up your mind about something, stick with it. Have confidence in your own mental process. Once you begin to waver, it may be difficult to find the assurance that you need since you'll inevitably slide down the slippery slope of self-doubt.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|1|Someone may challenge your mental capabilities today, Aries. Your natural tendency might be to take the information, mull it over for a while, and come back with your decision or opinion at some later date. The truth of the matter is that things are moving quickly and decisions must be made quickly and efficiently. Stay on your toes and have confidence in your mental processes.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|2|Unexpected information may be coming at you today from out of the blue, Taurus. You'll find that this information is extremely important, so make sure to keep all lines of communication open. You're apt to learn some important lessons regarding working harmoniously with groups to fulfill not just your own needs but also those of others. Let other people's viewpoints be heard.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|26|3|Don't be so nosy about others' affairs today, Gemini. If you were meant to be included in the conversation, you'd have been invited. Suspicion of other people's actions and motives will only cause them to lose their trust in you. Keep any abrasive and critical thoughts to yourself. Perfection is a hot topic in your mind. Realize that the only person you can control in that department is you.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|4|Other people could have some seriously opposing opinions about how things should be done. Be prepared for battle, Cancer, because others are likely to have sharp tongues. Compromise is the key to finding solutions that will work for everyone. Realize that the best solution is probably one that neither party has thought of on his or her own. Work together to come up with the best situation for everyone involved.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|26|5|Information is apt to come in erratic bursts today, Leo. You'll find that a great deal of nonverbal communication is revealed and you should listen not only with your ears but also with your eyes and heart. Keep an open mind. Let others finish their thoughts before you make any judgments. You're probably better off not making any judgments at all. Let people say their peace.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|26|6|An unexpected opportunity to take a short trip could present itself today, Virgo. Hop on that boat or train and see where it goes. If you have no real reason to travel, make one up. You don't need one anyway. The point is that it's time to get away from your current surroundings and explore other ways of living. If the time isn't right for you to get out and travel, at least make a plan now for a trip later.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|26|7|If you aren't paying close attention today, Libra, you might miss what's said. Important information is being relayed quickly, so don't miss out on the action. It may not be important for you to agree with everything you hear, but at least listen to it and seriously consider incorporating elements into your point of view. Don't dismiss other opinions just because they're new and different from your own.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|8|Actively express your thoughts today, Scorpio. You'll find that a great deal of information needs to be exchanged. You have the power to deliver a strong, thoughtful message to others, so don't give up this opportunity to exercise your acute mind. You may also find people to be rather argumentative, but don't let this keep you from expressing your true thoughts on the matter at hand.|Leo|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|9|You may be feeling a little bit lost in the dust today, Sagittarius. Somehow what you're thinking and feeling isn't exactly coordinating with the current conversation. Don't think you need to agree with the group just to feel like you fit in. Maintaining your own point of view is critical. You're better off rolling with the punches rather than trying to put up a fight.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|26|10|Your thinking is clear and sharp, Capricorn, and your mental awareness keen. You should use it to head toward new, forward-thinking projects. Don't waste your time beating around the bush. Cut right to the heart of the issue. You'll easily outwit your opponents in a game of Scrabble or chess. Engage in activities that exercise your brain. There's no reason for you to doubt yourself today.|Scorpio|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|26|11|You're apt to come up with some new, radical thoughts today, Aquarius, which you should feel free to share with others. There are opportunities around that you should grab hold of. Be aggressive about pushing ahead with your progressive thoughts. Communication with people who possess opposing viewpoints will prove quite valuable. Take a lesson from the bizarre and outlandish.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|26|12|Today is a terrific day to express your thoughts, Pisces. You'll find your mind especially clear and ready to tackle any mental issue that comes your way. Your tendency is toward free and unconventional ways of problem solving. Express the importance of being able to think for yourself. Write letters, make calls, and surprise someone with a personal visit. Connect with friends you haven't spoken with in a long time.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|1|Today is one of those days in which if you want love, you need to go out and get it, Aries. Don't waste your time sitting at home and sulking. Be adventuresome and take that first step. You're the only one who has the ability to pull yourself out of the rut, so do it. There is a great deal of passion behind your romantic intentions at this time, Cupid, so be careful where you point your arrow.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|7|27|2|Things should flow extremely well for you today, Taurus, especially when it comes to anything having to do with love and beauty. Throw a party, or at least invite some close friends over for dinner. A tremendous fire from within fuels your romantic and social nature. Your creativity is at a monthly peak, and you'll find that, in general, your relationships with others will go extremely well.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|3|You might have to do a bit of adjusting today in order to experience a harmonious understanding with the people around you, Gemini. Adopt a feistier and more aggressive attitude toward love and romance if you want to receive any attention in that area. Feel free to go for the gold. Sitting back and lying low will most likely get you nowhere. Take the initiative. Be brave and go out on a limb.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|27|4|Your love life is a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors today, Cancer, full of complicated patterns and ever-changing displays of beauty. A new perspective is revealed everywhere you turn, and you learn something new about yourself and the people you're involved with. Remain open to partnership on multiple levels in which you experience different types of commitment with different people. It takes every color to make a complete rainbow.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|27|5|Turn up your aggressive nature regarding your romantic life, Leo. You may find that a small spark is all that's needed to rekindle a smoldering fire. You may be going through a period of transformation right now when it comes to this area of your life. If so, consider all the options and don't shy away from a new way of relating. Your partner may have the very answer you seek.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|27|6|Today is a very powerful day for you, Virgo. You may find yourself going to extremes in certain areas of your life, especially when it comes to your romantic nature. You could be pulled way over to one side and then to the other. At first you may give it your all and the next minute completely withdraw. Try to find a balance in this seesaw game.|Gemini|Scorpio|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|7|You may not understand what all the fuss is about today, Libra. Suddenly there's a fire burning all around and you may be left questioning the motivations behind others' actions. You may not be able to make heads or tails of the situation, so don't waste your time trying to figure it all out. Let it be. Take a hint from others that you may need to add a bit of spark to your life to spice things up a bit.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|8|Get your broom out of the closet today, Scorpio. Your job is to brush away the cobwebs from the corners of your emotional bedroom. Use the intense transformative energy of the day to say goodbye to stale and unsatisfactory relationships that have left a bad taste in your mouth. Ignite the fire of a new situation and consciously try to establish new habits so that old patterns don't continue to repeat themselves.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|27|9|There may be a great deal of charge in your battery today, Sagittarius, but you could be unsure about where to put all this energy. Get up and do some exercise. Give your body the workout it needs. Remember what it's like to sweat. You'll feel much better about yourself afterward, and you'll be much more likely to continue on a healthy path if you push your body to its limits.|Libra|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|27|10|Let your love light shine today, Capricorn. There's a great deal of passion in your heart that needs to be expressed. Let your romantic nature take the reins, and allow your creative nature to blossom. Be assertive with regard to the ones you love. Muster your courage and feel free to take the lead. Be loving and caring without being smothering and clingy. Give others room to breathe!|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|11|People might be a bit argumentative when it comes to romantic issues today, Aquarius. Your instincts could be telling you to restrain yourself and hold back, while the prevailing winds are urging you to strike out for new ground. Realize that your heart may need a bit of freedom and detachment. Your sensitive nature could be causing you to read too much into the issues at hand.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|27|12|Consider going on a trip with a close loved one, Pisces. A long-term break from the current reality may be just the thing needed to infuse a new blast of romance into your life. If you're unattached, you might find that going on an adventure to a foreign country results in meeting the love of your life. Broaden your horizons and look to new ways of thinking and believing.|Scorpio|Taurus|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|28|1|There are extremely slow-moving, subtle energies coming into play today that may not be so easily felt, Aries. What they provide is a key to manifesting your wildest dreams. Fantasy can become your reality, but it may only come one small, subtle step at a time. Don't give up. Focus on the unconventional way to get things done. You'll eventually achieve everything your heart desires as long as you truly believe you can.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|28|2|There may be a great deal of conflict in your life today, Taurus. Different people and situations seem to be pulling you in all directions. Your sanity is being put to the test. Try not to be too stubborn, because this will only cause more tension between you and the situation. You have the potential to stress out about the smallest things. Try to avoid this if you can.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|28|3|Today you should work to tune into the larger, slower-moving trends in your life, Gemini. Consider making some long-term monetary and emotional investments. There is a great deal of prosperity available to you now, but beware of deception on the part of others. Watch out for fast talkers and people who promise everything yet deliver nothing. Have confidence that you can decipher what's real and what isn't.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|28|4|Let your artistic nature loose today, Cancer. Add a touch of creativity to whatever project, situation, or person you encounter. Let your fantasy world extend to every aspect of your being and keep an open mind for new ideas and methods. Incorporate traditional values into new concepts. The new and the old methods may seem incompatible at first, but it's your challenge to make them work together.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|28|5|Don't gamble away your resources, Leo. Take the safest route. There's a great deal of energy out there encouraging you to act, but beware of adopting too stubborn of an attitude. This will only succeed in alienating you from the very people you rely on for support. Maintain a strong, healthy balance between old and new. Try to be more open to change and, by all means, adopt a more flexible attitude.|Taurus|Libra|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|28|6|Get things out in the open today, Virgo. If someone seems to insult you, call them on it. Letting things fester inside only destroys your self-esteem. You'd also be in danger of losing the respect of others. This could very well be a situation in which everyone but you sees the truth. Try not to let this happen. Be bold and assertive, and don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.|Gemini|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|28|7|Stick to the tried and true today, Libra. Don't be afraid to make any last-minute changes of plan. Compliment others when they do something well, and show appreciation for their positive qualities. You'll gain their respect. Celebrate the small things in life and appreciate all that you have - physically as well as emotionally. Let other people share in your warm and generous spirit.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|28|8|Reap all the riches that a new day has to offer, Scorpio. Every day brings new opportunities and the chance for rapid advancement. Grab the things offered to you. You have a great deal of potential, but potential is one of those things that does no good until you realize it and harness it. Today is one day in which you can take an important step toward manifesting your dreams.|Virgo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|28|9|You may need to adjust today in order to relate well to people and situations, Sagittarius. Things are a bit off kilter, and you may find that the harder you try to fit in, the more liable you are to feel like an oddball. Try not to get caught up in others' battles. Maintain a balance between real life and fantasy. Don't get so caught up in someone else's world that you forget to deal with your own.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|28|10|Be yourself today - 100 percent you, Capricorn. The world needs more individuality. Revel in your unique qualities and be generous about sharing them with the world. Feel free to adopt a new and unconventional way of doing something - anything. Beware, however, that there may be a strong, grounding force that's trying to tie you down to tradition. Don't feel pressured to give in to the social norm.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|28|11|Today is a very expansive day in which you can make great progress in all of your endeavors, Aquarius. Be careful of deception by others. There may be a surreal cloud that covers up reality. You may need to do a little digging to locate the truth. Maintain a mellow attitude in order to stay safe. Sudden, extreme actions fueled by anger or fear are likely to get you into trouble.|Libra|Aries|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|28|12|Tune into your dreams today, Pisces. Do you often feel intensely jealous thinking the people around you are living amazing lives while you're stuck in a dull, boring routine? The only person who can pull you out of this rut is you, so stop complaining and do it. Change is easier than it seems at first. Let your imagination take control and work toward manifesting your most fanciful goals.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|29|1|Your mental clarity is astounding today, Aries. You'll find that your pattern of thinking reflects exactly who you are at the core of your being. The moment you walk out the door this morning, you'll find that your brain wants to process everything. This action will give you greater assuredness and insight, making this a terrific day to stand up and speak your mind.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|29|2|Tune into the thoughts of others, Taurus. Focusing only on yourself means you're missing the beauty and wisdom that come from other people. Respect their opinions the way you want them to respect yours. Your ego might get in the way of your brain until you embrace the lesson of sensitivity that it's trying to teach you. Take a back seat and let someone else do the talking.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|29|3|You'll find that your brain is extra sharp today and you have a greater sense of clarity regarding your purpose in life. It could be that your nurturing instinct is high and your general self-esteem depends on how useful you can be to the people around you. It may seem as if you're everyone's parent or watchful older sibling. Give people the advice they need to grow and be wiser.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|29|4|Many people conduct their lives without really making conscious decisions about their actions. People walk around like they're asleep. Don't fall into this trap, Cancer. This is a good day to dust off your thinking cap and take action. Don't let others make decisions for you. Take control of your destiny. To maintain the balance today, it's important that you swing toward the sensitive side of things.|Aries|Virgo|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|29|5|Your thinking is clear today and you'll find that it's right in sync with who you are, Leo. Find your strength in conversations in which you display your keen insight into the situation at hand. Your detective-like nature is especially active, and others will find it hard to pull the wool over your eyes now. Stay tuned in to what's going on around you.|Taurus|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|29|6|It's OK to be wrong, Virgo. If you know you've made a mistake, feel free to admit it. Don't let your ego stand in the way of progress. Others won't want to deal with you if you insist that what you're doing is right all the time when perhaps it isn't. Your mind may be a bit more fragile on a day like this, so try to be more sensitive and receptive than usual.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|29|7|Be careful about being too critical today, Libra. You're likely to turn people away if you aren't careful with how you express yourself. This is a good time to listen and receive as opposed to deliver information. Let things stew in your head for a while before you make any major decisions. You're likelier to find a greater balance in the situation if you slow down and back off a bit.|Leo|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|29|8|Your mental ability could be rather sluggish and lazy today. It could be that you aren't feeling as sharp as you'd like, Scorpio. This is most likely a sign that you simply need to slow down and relax. Don't feel as if you always need to deliver the keynote address. Be more of an audience member today and take advice from the other people up on stage.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|29|9|One of the important lessons of the day for you is to remember that emotions are powerful things to recognize and honor. Don't discount your feelings. In fact, it's most important that you embrace them with your whole being. Once you relax and settle into your true emotions, you'll find that your mind clears and you can make conscious, rational decisions about whatever issues come your way.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|29|10|Someone may be calling you on certain behaviors today, Capricorn. It could be that your aggressive nature rubs someone the wrong way and they simply don't have thick enough skin to take it. You may not even be aware of how your warlike attitude affects those around you. This is a good day to see things from someone else's perspective in order to gain a bit more data on the situation.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|29|11|Your mind is thinking quite clearly today, Aquarius. You'll discover that you have a keen ability to tune into the subtle energies that are moving through your life right now.

2016|7|29|12|Your receptivity to new ideas is stronger than usual today, Pisces. Listen to what people say and remember that you can learn from every person you meet. There's a lesson in every situation. Remember to keep your brain exercised, just like any other part of your body. To keep it working properly, you must make sure you give it the daily stimulus that it requires.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|30|1|You should always leave a loved one with loving words, Aries. Each time you exit a room, consider that you're never going to enter that room again. Perhaps you'll never see those people again. Make sure you take care of the people you like. People might need extra attention today to feel appreciated and important to you. Cuddle up to the people who mean the most to you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|30|2|Just when you think you have absolutely no energy left, you're able to kick into a higher gear. Push beyond your limits today, Taurus. You'll find that you can achieve a great deal more than you thought. All you need to do is have confidence in yourself and try. You have a lot of dynamic power on your side. You will find that your strength is greater than ever.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|30|3|Regardless of how you feel today, Gemini, it's important to own up to your mistakes. Keep in mind that you're responsible for your actions. No matter how much you might want to shrink away, it's important to stand up and admit your weaknesses. Take bold action today in which you command control of the situation and hold yourself responsible for the consequences.|Pisces|Leo|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|30|4|There's an important lesson to learn today, Cancer, so don't shy away from the classroom. It's important to control your attitude now or it's likely to control you. It could be that your ego is a bit too inflated. You may end up turning people away if you aren't aware of how your actions affect them. Or it could be that you need to change your approach.|Aries|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|30|5|Consider the romantic relationships in your life right now, Leo. It's important to remember that regardless of how hot and steamy a partnership is at first, it's vitally important that there be something to replace that attraction once the initial romance wears off. Build your relationships from the ground up. Make sure that your romantic partner is also one of your very best friends.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|30|6|Today is your day to become a hero, Virgo. You don't have to be dressed in fancy tights and a cape to make an important difference in someone's life. Step up to the plate even if it isn't your turn at bat. True heroes are the ones who are able to do what needs to be done when necessary, regardless of the circumstances.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|30|7|There's a great deal of fun to be had today, Libra. Money isn't always necessary to make this happen, however. In fact, money isn't a great way to keep score. Consider the sacrifices you make each time you strive to earn more cash. There's a dynamic feeling in the air today that's asking you to expand your mind in order to consider other ways to have fun.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|30|8|Remember that the important thing isn't necessarily what you're doing but the people you're with, Scorpio. There's a great deal of passion in the air today that you can latch onto and put to good use. Have fun and remember to smile. You can make a great deal of progress toward your goals as long as you stay motivated. Connect with others and feel the strength of shared resources.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|30|9|You could learn a tough lesson today, Sagittarius. More than likely, the harder the message hits you, the more important it was for you to hear. It's important that you accept failure gracefully. It could be that the one who kicks you when you're down will also be the one who helps you get up. There are strange twists to this day that you may not expect. Take things in stride.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|30|10|There's a great deal of fuel to keep your fire raging today, Capricorn. Powerful situations are apt to come your way in which you're asked to take decisive action. Don't shy away from added responsibility. Your ego is very strong, which helps you take charge of any situation. Just make sure that you don't step on anyone's toes in the process.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|30|11|Remember that one wrong move today could cause you to have a headache for a good long while, Aquarius. Don't take uncalculated risks. There's dynamism and confidence in the air, and even though you may be tempted to step off the ledge, think twice about doing so. Keep your parachute handy. Maintain your internal power by celebrating your uniqueness instead of your need to show off your daredevil spirit.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|30|12|It's a long road to becoming exactly the person you want to be, Pisces. You can't change who you are. Input from every person you know and lessons from every bump in the road contribute to who you are as a person. Be proud of yourself, but also realize that there's a great deal more internal development that needs to be done. Meditate or be alone for a little while.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|1|This is the beginning of an exciting period in your love life, Aries. Your relationship with a significant other may have been in a rut lately, but that's about to change. Both of you are ready for something big. Perhaps a move is in store or you could both decide commit to one another more permanently. Follow your instincts, because they'll lead you where you're meant to go.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|7|31|2|You have a passionate nature, Taurus. Sometimes it's difficult for you when other people don't share your exuberance. This is a good time to tone things down a notch. There's some tension in the air, and your enthusiasm only serves to annoy rather than charm, as it usually does. Don't pout. It's only temporary. Tomorrow you'll be the center of attention again and bestowing hugs and kisses to all.|Aquarius|Cancer|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|3|This is going to be a rather intense day, Gemini. On the positive side, you'll accomplish a lot. On the less positive side, you may be exhausted by the end of the day. You're advised to try and pace yourself. Remain focused on what's truly important rather than let yourself get caught up in trivia. Keep the big picture in mind and the little things will take care of themselves.|Pisces|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|4|Today it's important that you make your own decisions and stick with them, Cancer. Much as you prefer to depend on others, your judgment really is best. You'll be paralyzed if you think only of how others will react to your decisions. You do know what is best, and everyone will benefit when you act on your beliefs. This is no time to be wishy-washy. Just do it.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|31|5|You're a dreamer, Leo. Everyone loves you for it, but today the planetary aspects urge practicality. There are personal issues to resolve, and it does no good to have your head in the clouds. This is a time to focus on loved ones. Perhaps your partner or your children feel neglected. Do whatever is necessary to let your family know you're available and eager to give them what they need.|Gemini|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|31|6|Much has happened recently, Virgo. Have you allowed enough time to process it? It's likely that big changes are brewing at home or work. Stay focused on the job at hand rather than fret about events over which you have no control. You may feel as if you're on a roller-coaster ride, but everything will settle down in a few days. Blink to adjust your eyes to the strange new light.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|7|You've made progress these past few weeks, especially where your temper is concerned, Libra. It has taken some effort, but it does seem that you can overcome your tendency to speak before thinking. Don't lose the ground you've gained. There's one person whose mission seems to be to make you explode. Don't let him or her rankle you. Take a deep breath and rise above it.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|8|This is likely to be an intense day, Scorpio. Family and friends may seem testy, so you're advised to stay out of their way. Don't worry - it isn't anything you've done. It's the planetary energy. If you can go someplace private and shut the door, do it. If someone tries to pick a fight, don't rise to the bait. Tomorrow the air will clear and good spirits will reign again.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|7|31|9|This isn't the most cheerful time, Sagittarius, because important issues are rearing their heads again and forcing you to address them. You'd rather not, but you can't wish them away. The time has come to deal with them once and for all. It's especially important that you make an effort to make your home life more positive and upbeat. Your loved ones look to you to set the tone.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|7|31|10|Don't try to force anything or anyone right now, Capricorn. You'll find that today's elements are just as stubborn as you are. Today's planetary configurations will force you to finally start to turn your dreams into reality, whether you want to or not. Face it - you've been planning for a long time without making much concrete progress. All that is about to change.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|7|31|11|You're incredibly productive, with good business sense, Aquarius. However, lately you may have felt dissatisfied with where you are in life. As you look around, you might wish you had more possessions to show for all your hard work. Don't pursue this line of thought. Real value comes from relationships and the pride you get from doing a job well. A new car or fancy clothes may lift your spirits, but it's superficial.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|7|31|12|"You have a keen analytical mind that has served you well in business. Alas, Pisces, this characteristic doesn't always serve you well in your personal life. It's likely that someone close has bristled from your lack of empathy. Take time to reflect upon the events of the past few weeks. Did you inadvertently send a wrong message? Correct any unintentional slights. A simple ""I'm sorry,"" will do wonders."|Capricorn|Cancer|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|1|1|Separate the wheat from the chaff today. Look at your relationships and decide who your true friends are. You're loyal, which is to your credit, but why be loyal to people who don't return it? You've given these so-called friends plenty of chances to demonstrate their affection. It's time to let them fall by the wayside and free up time to spend with your real friends.|Capricorn|Gemini|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|1|2|Whether you acknowledge it or not, Taurus, creation is the central theme of your life. If you aren't an artist or writer, you should be. There are plenty of creative ideas in your head clamoring to be expressed. Why not give it a try? You have nothing to lose, and you may be astonished by what you're able to produce. Your brain does have two sides. It's time to use both.|Aquarius|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|1|3|You seem to be filled with questions, Gemini. Some of them are big, some trivial. All you know is that they preoccupy you, and the answers aren't readily apparent. Don't fret. All that will change by day's end. The planetary configurations are such that all the confusing events of recent days will begin to make sense. Your world will once again seem calm and orderly. Enjoy it.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|1|4|You're an individual, Cancer, but sometimes it's hard for you to suppress your uniqueness in order to get the job done. It may not be you. The problem may be your job. If you're feeling like you don't have enough fun in your life or you aren't using the full potential of your creativity, this might be a good time to make a change - a big change. You're ready to take on new challenges.|Taurus|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|1|5|Your ego may be bruised by events from a few days back. Has it occurred to you that it's within your power to right the wrong you feel was done to you? It isn't a matter of confrontation but of conversation. The person in question is probably unaware of what they did or said. An expression of your dismay might elicit an apology. You'll both feel better for having cleared the air.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|1|6|Today's planetary configurations are pushing you to get some perspective on your life and the lives of people closest to you, Virgo. You must admit that you've been rather selfish lately. You aren't the center of the universe, so why do you sometimes act like you are? This is a day to make amends with friends and loved ones. They'll welcome you back with open arms.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|1|7|This is a day to be up front with your partner, Libra. It's possible that your relationship has reached some sort of stalemate. It's up to you to get that fire burning brightly once again. How? You know the drill - romantic time alone is all it takes. A nice outfit, a reservation at the best restaurant, and you and your mate are back in business.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|1|8|This is a day of untold opportunity, Scorpio. If you've been concerned that you haven't been using your full creative potential, you can put that concern to rest today. Your creativity is boundless and you'll finally realize it. Be on the lookout for any unusual opportunities. Someone or something you encounter could have meaningful ripple effects on you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|1|9|There's tension in the air today, Sagittarius. Even though it isn't your doing, you may want to keep a low profile, especially if you need to work. Try to avoid any discussions. Just because someone is confrontational doesn't mean you have to rise to the bait. It would be better if you didn't. Keep to yourself and all of this will blow over by tomorrow when it will be safe to mingle again.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|1|10|You're a dreamer at heart, Capricorn. You prefer not to think about material things. That explains why you tend to forget groceries or dry cleaning. You're happiest if things get done for you. But circumstances today will force you to handle some of these mundane chores. You'll feel better by day's end just knowing you can be self-sufficient even if you don't want to be.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|1|11|If you follow your instincts and dare to take some risks, Aquarius, you'll be handsomely rewarded. You have the capability to make a good project great. Do your best not to get distracted today. Keep your eye on the big picture rather than let yourself get bogged down in details. You'll find that when you take care of the big issues, the little ones take care of themselves.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|1|12|Finally, Pisces, you'll be able to breathe a long overdue sigh of relief. It's likely that you've been worried about your finances for some time. Well, you need worry no longer. The events of today either put you back in the black or show you a clear path to get there. You've been working hard to resolve these financial matters. You can now start working smarter.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|1|Your mind is clear and your sensitivity focused, Aries. Now is a good time to make a move. Don't let insecurity or fear keep you from pursuing your dreams. Realize that action you take today doesn't need to be a bold outward movement in order to be effective. In truth, quite the contrary is true. You can accomplish a great deal by turning thought and energy inward.|Capricorn|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|2|Cool your jets today, Taurus. This is a good time to stop and focus on you. Make sure to give your body the respect it deserves. Make sure you're fostering the kind of character you wish to become. Base your self-image on something internal rather than an external craving for attention from others. Your true beauty lies within.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|2|3|Your brain and warrior instincts are in agreement today, Gemini. Team up with others who share similar thoughts and desires. Conversations can be extremely rewarding. You're apt to learn a lot about yourself. Don't be afraid to share deep thoughts and emotions. Your willingness to express yourself demonstrates how comfortable you are with your actions and feelings.|Aries|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|2|4|Something or someone could confront you today, Cancer. Try not to assume things about the situation before you know all the facts. If a piece of the puzzle is still in question, face the issue right away. Your sensitivity is precious, whether you realize it or not. Small things can slowly eat away at your psyche until they're addressed and dealt with.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|5|Have no fear today, Leo. You have the power and mental capacity to cut through just about anything. Don't let fear or regret hold you back. Clear the path and be strong in your approach to the new and different. Stay on target and be bold in your actions. You have the ability to conquer new literal and figurative lands. Release mental blocks that might hinder your success.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|6|Don't worry about not being on the right path, Virgo, because you are. You seem to always be in the right place at the right time. There's no need to feel regret or shame about things that have happened in the past. Turn negative experiences into lessons for a better future. Even though you may not be able to change a certain situation, you can at least change your reaction to it.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|2|7|A war could be brewing in your world today, Libra. Emotionally charged arguments shoot back and forth with conviction. Try not to get discouraged. Don't burn any bridges either. Remember that your words may fall on extremely sensitive ears, so use them with care. There's a very active part of your psyche that needs to be heard. Feel free to say your peace openly and honestly.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|2|8|An inner voice is warning you to slow down, Scorpio. It's probably best if you take a break and let someone else take the lead. Concentrate on matters at home and take care of issues that crop up among loved ones. It's quite possible that an argument is brewing. Whether you realize it or not, there are serious issues that need to be addressed.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|2|9|Today is a fantastic day to take action, Sagittarius. Your eagerness to strike out for new territory is heightened by a drive to experience the unknown. Take an internal journey and see what kind of wonderful things you can discover. There's a tremendous strength inside you that doesn't always get to show itself. This is the perfect day to prove your courage to the world.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|10|Think before you act today, Capricorn. Rash moves are likely to get you into trouble. An annoying interruption in your daily routine could throw you off guard. Sit down and think about the situation before you act too hastily. Bumps in the road are often messages from the Universe that you're moving too quickly and carelessly. It's time to slow down.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|2|11|Today is a great day to act on things that have been brewing in your brain for quite some time, Aquarius. Perhaps you've been feeling unsure of yourself. It's OK to surrender and admit that you just don't have all the answers. Use this as an opportunity to restructure and rebuild. Embrace the unknown rather than fear or resist it. This is a great time to move toward it.|Scorpio|Taurus|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|2|12|Be a bit more sensitive with your words today, Pisces. Your mind is apt to be especially active and even a bit restless. This is more than likely a signal to get more of your opinions out into the world. As you do, make sure you take into account the feelings of others. People might have quite a different reaction to the same situation. Respect opposing viewpoints.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|1|Love and romance are coming your way today, but it's important to be practical, Aries. Don't take your relationships for granted. Realize that love doesn't necessarily mean that everything is perfect. Structure and discipline are often required in order to maintain a healthy partnership. You should be able to incorporate these elements rather well, so make the most of this energy.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|3|2|You probably should settle down a bit today in the love and romance department, Taurus. Realize that your relationships with others aren't a show or stage act to perform. This is a day when you should listen to feedback from your partner and think about restructuring certain elements of your relationship in order to make things flow more smoothly.|Pisces|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|3|3|Sit back and observe others' behavior today, Gemini. Take a look at the people around you and figure out what makes them tick. You'll find that you can learn a great deal from their actions and mistakes. Consider your role models and people you wish to emulate. Think about the traits that attract you to certain people and work to adopt those traits yourself.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|4|Your love life might be a little fragile, and you'll find that your partner is more sensitive than usual, Cancer. A more caring, emotional approach to a situation will help you form a better connection with your partner. Today you'll find that clear boundaries need to be established in order to keep things running smoothly between you and your loved ones.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|5|Things in the love and beauty department should be going rather well for you now, Leo, so it's a good time to make a move toward the object of your desire. Make sure that you're being completely realistic in your actions. Realize that you may need some discipline in this area. Maintain a healthy structure within which you can work.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|3|6|Slow down and take a more reserved, sensitive, and calculated approach to things today, Virgo, especially when it comes to matters involving love and beauty. You'll find a greater level of sensuality waiting for you when you're willing to open up the door even wider. Go after the object of your desire, but make sure that your approach is sensitive and disciplined.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|3|7|You may be at a rather climactic point now in the department of love and beauty, Libra. Your creative levels are peaking and you might feel a strong urge to create something on a giant canvas. Realize that discipline is needed to get those artistic juices flowing. Don't let fear stop you. Initiate your dreams and let the details fall into place later.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|3|8|Pieces of your life that you've tried to avoid for some time may come to the surface today and cause you a bit of trouble, Scorpio. That which isn't organized or structured is getting more and more chaotic just to teach you a lesson. Take care of things now. Put things in order and become more aware of the ticking of the clock. There's a reason you need to take care of business.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|9|Cupid has fired his arrow into your heart today, Sagittarius, so snuggle up with the object of your desire. You'll feel more sensual and romantic than usual. Gourmet foods and fine wines should grace your plate tonight. Realize that there may be an element of restraint that needs to get worked into the equation, but don't let this stop you from having a good time.|Libra|Aries|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|3|10|You may feel a bit of a creative block now, Capricorn, but don't view this as a signal to stop pursuing your artistic goals. The truth of the matter is that discipline is all that's needed to manifest the things you really want. Don't let other people's energies get in the way of where you are now and where you want to be. Get back in the flow.|Libra|Aries|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|11|Today is an important day in which you can breathe creative energy into a structured situation, Aquarius. You'll find that bolstering the aesthetics of your surroundings will help inspire you to be more disciplined and eager to keep things neat and tidy. Take your time and don't let other people's anxiety cause you to rush into anything you aren't ready for.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|3|12|Be a bit more selective in terms of where you put your energy today, Pisces. Don't waste your time with situations that aren't healthy or conducive to your aims. You may find it hard to get motivated, but this is fine. This is a good day to lay low. Your energy is apt to feel rather sluggish, so be conservative with how you use it. Pace yourself throughout the day.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|4|1|The wind is blowing quite strongly today, and you'll find that things are flying around in a frenzy, Aries. This whirlwind of activity is threatening to pick you up, spin you around, and take you away. Be cautious of anything that suggests this. People may take on unrealistic attitudes that lure you into grand schemes. Beware of fanciful promises.|Aquarius|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|4|2|Things are sporadic today, Taurus. You may find a thousand things on your plate, and all of them look delicious. There's a great deal of wind to fuel your fire, so let it burn red hot. You might get caught up in a frenzy of activity. Have a good time but realize that it might not last forever. The royal carriage is likely to turn back into a pumpkin at some point.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|4|3|Don't get pulled off track by empty promises today, Gemini. Someone may try to sell you oceanfront property in the middle of Iowa. Beware of things that sound too good to be true. People may be talking quite a bit, but in reality they probably have nothing to say. Don't waste your time trying to make sense of useless drivel. You've got more important things to do.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|4|4|Catch the wave of activity that's spinning in your direction today, Cancer. You'll find prosperity and good fortune within your reach. Expand your horizons and connect with others intellectually. Hurdles will shrink to nothing as long as you maintain a positive attitude. It will be tremendously easy for you to make great strides in any project you're working on.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|4|5|You may find it hard to trust others today, Leo. Trust your instincts - they're probably right. Don't take anything at face value. There's a fanciful frenzy that's threatening to lure you into its madness. Approach things cautiously. You may discover that people are full of hot air. If it doesn't have real meaning for you, don't waste your time.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|4|6|There may be a bit of opposition coming at you, Virgo. There's a light, airy feeling that's prevalent everywhere. This is definitely the kind of energy you can connect with today. There's a great deal of strength in numbers. Don't let anyone try to stand in your way. It could very well be that they are operating on incorrect information.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|4|7|What seems like the perfect plan today may not necessarily seem like the perfect plan tomorrow, Libra. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's working to catch you up in its net and pull you into its plan. Beware of get-rich-quick schemes. The wool could get pulled over your eyes on a day like this.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|4|8|There's a flurry of activity around you today that you should latch onto, Scorpio. You'll be on a magic carpet ride that takes you into the clouds. The most difficult thing to remember is to not get so carried away that you lose sight of the ground. Keep in mind that things aren't always exactly the way they seem. What appears to work perfectly today may not work at all tomorrow.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|4|9|You'll find yourself working well with any group today, Sagittarius. There will be a great connection between you and the people around you. Make sure you ground your relationships in something meaningful or else you could find that you've built a whole reality out of something that doesn't exist. Be true to yourself and try not to get fooled by anything that seems too good to be true.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|4|10|There's an incredibly expansive feeling in the air that you should latch onto, Capricorn. Things are moving rapidly. You'll find long-term trends come together quite well. The thing to be aware of today is making sure you're operating based on facts you know to be true. Check your sources. Be cautious, but if you see an opportunity that looks good, run with it.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|4|11|Sticking close to home may leave you feeling like you're missing the boat on certain things, but you're probably better off, Aquarius. People may make outlandish promises that sound good today but will basically flop tomorrow. Stay safe and don't invest a great deal of time or money in risky ventures. Keep moving at a steady pace. You'll find success your own way.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|4|12|You're riding a wave of prosperity and things are looking up for you, Pisces. The situation today may appear too good to be true. The bad news is that's probably the case. It may be that the truth is being masked, and that there's a great deal of speculation and hype causing a frenzy of activity. Feel free to join the frivolity, but realize that the bubble may burst tomorrow.|Scorpio|Cancer|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|5|1|A friend or colleague involved in an enterprise with you could be inhibited in some way by lack of money, Aries. This might involve some unexpected adjustment on your part, perhaps finding someone else to temporarily fill in. It's a pain, but you and your colleagues will manage, and your friend should have it together in time. Find a way to work around the situation. Hang in there.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|5|2|Career responsibilities may require a temporary separation from a love partner today, Taurus. This is apt to be upsetting and rather disheartening, but there's likely nothing you can do about it except work as quickly as you can so that you can finish and get back to your partner. Make sure your friend knows what's going on. You don't want to cause any more upset.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|5|3|Travel arrangements may have to be put off because of unexpected developments that keep you where you are, Gemini. You may be worried about the consequences, but don't waste your energy. You'll be able to make the necessary trip, and accomplish whatever you're hoping to do - just not today. Worry will only stress you out. The only productive way to deal with this is to keep moving.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|5|4|You may feel especially lonely, overworked, and passionate today, Cancer, and therefore longing for the company of your romantic partner. But responsibilities involving you both could well be keeping you apart. This could be more than frustrating - it could make you gloomy. Don't let that happen. Concentrate on your work and finish before evening. You'll see your friend then.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|5|5|Upsets in the home could occur today, Leo. You and other members of your household are on edge and liable to snap at the least provocation. Someone could get all flustered over a minor problem and storm out. Don't worry. At day's end everyone should see events in their proper perspective and all be friends again. Hang in there.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|5|6|Expected calls or deliveries may prove more trouble than they're worth, Virgo. You could get involved in endless games of phone tag, and deliveries might come when you're out. This can be avoided if you're prepared. Make sure everyone knows what you're expecting so they can watch for it. Tell people the best times to phone and be available at those times. Don't worry. You'll manage.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|5|7|A temporary delay in receiving some expected funds might force you to postpone a much-needed purchase, Libra. Don't make yourself crazy over this. It isn't worth the stress. The delay is disheartening, but it isn't a cancellation. Your money will arrive and you'll be able to go ahead with your plans. In the meantime, keep yourself busy. Hang in there.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|5|8|Some older visitors to your home, perhaps your parents, might be too vocal in their assessment of how you're handling a situation, Scorpio. You're particularly sensitive today, and far less tolerant of criticism than usual. Don't lash out. Causing a rift won't solve anything. Change the subject and take whatever course of action you feel is best.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|5|9|"Beware that creative efforts involving modern technology, such as computer graphics, recording, or film, might suffer from ""too many cooks."" Everyone has a different idea of how things should be handled. If this is your project, make sure everyone knows you're the boss. If you have partners, discuss the situation rationally with them. Don't sabotage your enterprise because of disagreements. Talk it over.
                
             "|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|5|10|In spite of the leaps and bounds you've taken over the last several months, Capricorn, a slump could set in as you start to doubt your ability to attain your goals. A disheartening and unexpected setback may have occurred, but you've never let this sort of thing stop you before. Don't fall into this trap now. Brace yourself, reassess your methods, and get back in the saddle.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|5|11|Are you waiting to hear some important news, Aquarius? Significant career matters may be involved. This isn't a good day to sit around waiting. Your call will probably come late, when you least expect it. Turn on your voicemail, get dressed, and go out and do something else for a while. Otherwise you could well drive yourself crazy hoping for the news. Hang in there.|Libra|Gemini|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|5|12|This isn't a good day to travel, Pisces, especially by air. Long lines at the ticket counter, endless delays, and lost luggage could be the result. This may not even be a good day to plan a trip, although you can consider your options. If you must fly today, get to the airport early, travel light, and take something good to read. That will make it bearable.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|1|Your psychic sense is apt to be keen as you fill your mind with fanciful scenarios, Aries. These pictures in your head aren't as farfetched as you might think. Today would be a good day to listen to your inner guidance - the aspect of yourself that's keyed into hearing subtle important messages. Not everyone can pick up on them.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|2|You may be having a difficult time getting your opinions across to others, Taurus. For some, your ideas may seem too self-centered. For others, you may come across as insensitive to the situation. Do your best to understand what others are telling you. Don't be surprised if you don't receive the loving strokes that you feel you deserve. This is a day for you to observe and learn.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|6|3|The emotional swings that you could feel today might put a damper on your fantasy world, Gemini. Remember that it's up to you to nurture these dreams. Try not to let the emotional tides of the day affect your long-range strategy for realizing your most treasured visions. Spend time by yourself if that makes you feel better. Don't give up.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|6|4|People around you are apt to be touchy, Cancer, so be careful how you interact with them. You'll find that they can see beyond any sort of facade and easily detect dissention within the ranks. Be honest about your opinion, regardless of how you think it will be received. This is your best approach to a certain situation, especially since the truth will surface no matter what.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|6|5|While other people may be confused and distressed, you're actually the one with all the answers, Leo. Indeed, you're best equipped to deal with the difficult situations that are likely to arise on a day like this. You have the ability to see through thick walls that others erect as barriers. Nothing will stop your penetrating eyes from seeing someone else's deceit.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|6|Be passionate about the thing you love the most, Virgo. Instead of trying to eat every single thing at the buffet table, just pick one or two items that you like the best and eat them with great enjoyment. Feel free to take some for later. Don't let anyone talk you into a dish that doesn't appeal to you. You're the only one who knows what you truly hunger for.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|6|7|You may feel like a skipping record, Libra. You've been scratched and mistreated, and now you continue to repeat the same thing over and over until you've driven your point home. This isn't your doing, so don't be concerned if you hear protests that you're sending others over the edge. This may be the very thing necessary for all of you to advance to the next step.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|8|There could be some tough forces questioning your most cherished dreams, Scorpio. Be careful about confronting someone who wants to poke holes in your idealism. You could end up feeling like a punctured balloon that's slowly deflating. Do whatever you can to avoid the aggression at work to bring you down. Don't let others get to you.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|9|You're in a unique position to understand all sides of the issues, Sagittarius. While this is apt to give you a tremendous advantage over those who still have their heads stuck in the sand, this knowledge also gives you a greater responsibility to others. You intuitively know what's best, and now you must find a way to bring others around and help them see it from your perspective.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|6|10|You may be feeling rather anxious, Capricorn. Perhaps you have a big date coming up and your mind is buzzing with how to make the best impression. Remember that the harder you try, the further away you'll push the object of your desire. The most important part of impressing another is having confidence. Relax. Try not to get too caught up with yourself.|Virgo|Taurus|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|6|11|This could be one of those days in which you feel like you just can't get anything right, Aquarius. In an effort to appease other people, you may think you have to make some adjustments that make you feel uneasy. This uncomfortable feeling could turn into nervousness, restlessness, and eventually anger. Don't feel like you need to be the one to make any sacrifices at this time.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|6|12|You may feel a need to add some fantasy to your daily routine today, Pisces. Do you have someone in mind you'd like Cupid's arrow to strike? Well, don't rely on a cherub to do your work for you. Get out and do some target practice of your own so you'll be prepared when you see the object of your desire across a crowded room. Keep things light and cheerful.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|7|1|Sometimes your emotions overtake your rational thoughts, Aries, and you end up acting on impulse. Today you'll find that your head and heart are aligned on significant issues, and that they're working well together. Try not to swing the other way by becoming too rational. Your goal is to find the best working balance.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|7|2|Review your day as you watch the sunset and observe the clouds turning from white to purple, Taurus. Make sure that your head is in tune with your heart. Think about the day's emotions and thought patterns and how they affected your actions. Determine if your actions were a result of either your rational mind or fluctuating moods.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|7|3|Your mind is buzzing like a bee, Gemini. You're apt to find that there's very little you can do to slow it down. Make sure you add compassion to the chain that's holding everything together. Also make sure that you don't become a victim of your thoughts by losing control over how you act simply because the voice in your head has completely taken over.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|7|4|Mornings aren't usually your best time, Cancer. You aren't fully awake until afternoon. Try not to discount the events of this particular morning, however. More than likely, you'll enjoy your best mental clarity sometime before noon. Surprise people with an upbeat attitude and a solution for every problem that comes your way.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|7|5|Your world may seem rather tight and rigid this morning, Leo, but the good news is that difficulties are apt to melt away as the day progresses. Don't assume that opinions are fixed in stone. Things can change in an instant. Even if they seem one way at one point, more than likely they're going to manifest themselves completely differently later.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|7|6|This is one of those days in which you're better able to stand back and look at your emotions intellectually, Virgo. Your freedom-loving nature isn't built to deal with heavy emotional baggage and turmoil, so don't bother trying. Be especially wary of those who seem to plop a problem in front of you and expect you to deal with it.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|7|7|Prepare for a surprise today, Libra. Perhaps it will come from someone else or perhaps it will come from you. Either way, by evening you're apt to be feeling quite lovey-dovey and rather spaced out. Give in to the lethargic attitude that might sweep over you. This is your time to play, so put work aside and have a good time while letting your emotions dictate your actions.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|7|8|Things seem to be going quite well for you in many respects, Scorpio. Your thinking is clear, your emotions are under control, and the puzzle pieces are fitting into place. This is your time to take advantage of these pockets of good fortune and turn them into something huge. You have the power to make anything happen - especially now.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|7|9|Your engine may sputter this morning as your gears begin to turn, Sagittarius. It could be that you're working out something important in you mind that's helping clarify your emotions. The answer you seek is probably nothing like the one you'll find. By the time night comes, you'll have everything figured out. All the answers you need will be right there in front of you.|Leo|Aries|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|7|10|Be careful not to overdo things today, Capricorn. You may so zealously want to meet your goals that you overshoot the mark by quite a bit. Feel free to express your exuberance and let your enthusiasm shine in whatever you do. At the same time, be careful about getting so carried away that you don't notice that you've already reached the finish line.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|7|11|Tempers may get hot today when someone says something that pierces you to your core. Address this problem right away, Aquarius, instead of letting it fester through the rest of the day. The solution requires sensitivity and caring. Let the offender know that he or she has hurt you significantly, if that is indeed the case. There's no need for you to try to hide your feelings.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|7|12|Don't be surprised if you leap out of bed with a spark of inspiration that wasn't there last night, Pisces. Let your dreams linger a bit before you face the world. This flash of genius is likely to strike quickly and unexpectedly, so keep an eye out for it, but don't consider it something that you can plan on or force into happening.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|8|1|Some bizarre and rather silly dreams might come to you tonight, Aries. They may be the sort that is so crazy that you actually wake up laughing. Don't dismiss them. Silly or not, these dreams are trying to tell you something. Write them down the way you would any other vivid dream, and analyze the symbols in the same way - even if they cause a few giggles.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|8|2|If you're single, you could feel a very powerful attraction to someone unusual and perhaps a little wacky. If you're already in a relationship, you could glimpse a silly and rather insane side of your beloved you've never seen before. This could be a bit disconcerting but also make you laugh. That's part of the appeal of love - continuously learning about that special one.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|8|3|Have you been looking for a new job, Gemini? If so, you might hear of an opportunity from an unexpected source, perhaps at a social gathering. This could mean that someone unexpected brings it to your attention, or it could be a job in a new and unusual field. One way or another, as weird as it seems, it's worth consideration. Look into it and get all the facts before acting.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|8|4|If you're single, Cancer, love may come to you completely out of the blue today. The person could be standing behind you in line at the store or sitting at the next caf table. Wherever you connect, don't be too cautious. Move ahead carefully, but at least get to know something about this person before giving in to insecurity and running the other way.|Taurus|Scorpio|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|8|5|Some unexpected but very welcome visitors could arrive today, Leo. They might bring some people you don't know but should connect with right away. Expect interesting news, fascinating information, and a lot of laughs. Even though you don't know for sure that these people are coming, have a supply of drinks and snacks on hand. You'll want them to settle in and stay a while.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|8|6|Virgo, who's that intriguing new person in your neighborhood? What is it about this new neighbor that makes it impossible for you to stop wondering about them? Quit obsessing. Get your courage up and go over and introduce yourself. Welcome him or her to the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find this person likable, maybe not, but give it a shot anyway. Enjoy.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|8|7|An unexpected letter could arrive today, Libra, with a check enclosed, perhaps a gift, bonus, or offer to make more money. This might be a welcome break, possibly coming at a time when you really need it. If it's work, don't worry about the time involved. You'll be able to finish it quickly and efficiently. It might lead to more offers in the future.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|8|8|If you're in the arts or sciences, Scorpio, sudden inspiration could cause you to start or continue a project that means a lot to you. Some friends or group members could help out with useful information. Your mind may generate new ideas throughout the day. Once you've finished your work, take a walk and clear your head. Watch a video. If you don't, it could be hard to sleep tonight.|Cancer|Pisces|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|8|9|Meditation, dreams, or visions could bring amazing insights your way, Sagittarius. You might find them too bizarre to believe, at least at first, but follow-up research could reveal that what you've come up with is quite credible. Keep a journal of these revelations, because you might remember the gist but forget the details. They could be useful later when you pass your ideas on to others.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|8|10|You're an adventurous soul, Capricorn. Are you thinking about a little mischief today? Are you going to propose that you and a friend or perhaps your partner skip town for a day and forget about work, chores, and other routine matters? You've been bored lately, so who could blame you? If you decide to do this, make sure everyone knows what's up. You don't want to burn any bridges.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|8|11|An unexpected communication may come today from someone connected with your career, Aquarius. This is good news, but it may be so off the wall that you could walk around in a daze for a while trying to make sense of it all. Don't agonize too much. You've worked hard for and deserve whatever it is that's suddenly coming to you. Think of it as a karmic reward. Go celebrate!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|8|12|An unexpected chance to fly to a faraway place, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Pisces. A group might be involved, perhaps one connected with education. Do you lecture or teach? If so, this might be a chance to give a lecture in an exciting place you've never been to before. Get your materials together, pack your bag, and go. Have fun!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|1|A conflict between career and home obligations could arise today, Aries. You may feel powerless, so it could make you feel irritable. Try to think clearly and find a solution for your conundrum, then act on it. Avoid the temptation to quarrel with others. Go for a good workout in the evening. Whether dancing or jogging, just work off some of that frustration.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|9|2|This could be a challenging day, Taurus. You might receive a call that brings disconcerting news, making you angry or upset. You could be tempted to take it out on the caller, but don't. He or she is just the messenger. Short trips in the neighborhood could find you in impossible traffic. If you have to go out today, you might reach your destination more quickly by walking.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|3|Vivid dreams are likely to cause you to wake up feeling angry for no clear reason, Gemini. You might want to take a close look at your dreams and try to analyze them so you can understand the source of your anger and how best to get over it. Later today, some disconcerting news about money is likely to prove groundless, so don't get stressed out.|Aries|Libra|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|9|4|Either your lover or a colleague is likely to be irritable today, Cancer, which you might find upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little, if anything, to do with you or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of the way until your friend gets over it. This isn't a good day to host or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until tomorrow.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|5|Too many unfinished tasks may have you feeling pressured, Leo, creating unnecessary stress. Pace yourself and don't panic if you have to let some go for now. You're probably feeling more sensitive than usual, so you might also pick up stress from the people around you. Take periodic breaks and go for a walk. This should clear your head and make things easier for you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|6|Emotions run high as disagreements turn into quarrels among members of a group you're affiliated with, Virgo. Stay out of it. It won't do you any good to get involved. Write your impressions and share them after tempers have cooled. You might want to make one final push toward reaching a personal goal, but forces beyond your control could block you. Try to remain patient.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|9|7|Pressure to get unfinished tasks completed and new ones begun causes emotions to run high, Libra. Everyone, including you, is likely to feel tired and stressed, and quarrels may erupt. It might be best if you focus on the tasks at hand and ignore the petty squabbles that crop up around you. This will keep your blood pressure down and reassure those you want to impress.|Gemini|Aquarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|9|8|If you're involved in a class or any kind of group activity or social situation, be prepared for quarrels to break out among people there, Scorpio. You could find this counterproductive and useless. You might be tempted to try to break in and put a stop to it. It's best to stay out of it. Work out your frustration by walking home. You'll feel better.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|9|Frustration could tempt you to release that energy by spending a lot of money, Sagittarius. You might overindulge in food or drink or resort to impulse buying. Treat yourself a little, but don't go overboard. You don't want to get an upset stomach, and you won't want to have to take unwanted items back to the store. Get some exercise or throw your passion into creative pursuits.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|9|10|Frustrated energy resulting from an inability to put plans into action could have your nerves on edge today, Capricorn. You might be tempted to get into petty quarrels with those around you. Try to find other outlets for your energy in order to avoid this trap. There's also the danger that you might take impulsive action. Stop and think before you act or your efforts might be wasted.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|9|11|Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain could result in tension headaches today, Aquarius. It might be a good idea to start the day pacing yourself and concentrating on the most pressing tasks. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There's a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This would only make you feel worse.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|9|12|You're probably feeling especially energetic but with little if any outlet for your energy, Pisces. Increased irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, yoga, or aerobics. These can produce endorphins that override the stress. Go for it.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|1|Nervous tension could cause a temporary malaise that keeps your energy very low today. But there are tasks that need to be done, Aries, so you'll probably try to do them in spite of the way you feel. Try not to overwork yourself or take your weariness out on others. It's better to let some things go than make yourself and everyone else that much more stressed out.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|2|A group with which you're affiliated may be temporarily torn apart by quarrels among its members, Taurus. It's best to stay out of it. A friend could be having trouble and come to you for advice and help. Don't let yourself get too frustrated by his or her weakness. This could be a frustrating day for you, and one best spent concentrating on projects. All will be better tomorrow.|Pisces|Virgo|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|10|3|Changes taking place in your home could cause some temporary frustration tense nerves on the part of family members, Gemini. Perhaps you're moving or refurnishing or trying to do a thorough cleaning and everyone is getting into everyone else's way. Just try to get the job done as quickly as possible. Once it's done, tempers will subside and all will be well.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|4|Miscommunication with someone from far away could lead to bruised egos, heightened emotions, and angry phone calls. It's best not to get drawn into a quarrel, Cancer. Try to straighten it all out. Changes in your neighborhood could cause problems with travel, so be prepared for blocked streets and heavy traffic. Walk - it will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|5|Your talents as a psychologist could be put to work today when misunderstandings arise. Your companions aren't likely to be thinking straight and may not respond to reassurance, Leo. Use your intuition to find the best way to defuse the situation. Finances might cause some worry right now, but your ingenuity and money sense should put things right. Go out and have fun tonight.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|10|6|Someone who interests you could seem to be showing interest in someone else. This might arouse your insecurities and cause a bit of jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Virgo. All may not be as it seems. Try to discern the facts. Invitations to more than one social event on the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice. Make the one that suits you best.|Taurus|Capricorn|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|10|7|Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues, Libra, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who the person is. Try to get them to open up without exerting pressure. Unfinished tasks could drive you crazy. You may try to race through them, which can cause too much stress. Get the crucial ones done and let the others go. Relax with a movie tonight.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|8|Circumstances beyond your control might get in the way of attending a group event. This could cause some disappointment for you and others, Scorpio. It's best to find something else to do. Your own project is likely to need some attention, and this could prove to be a challenge that keeps you engrossed for hours. Treat yourself to dinner out tonight.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|10|9|A female visitor who needs some sympathy could come around today. She may want advice on some problems, Sagittarius, but she could also bring information, possibly involving new scientific or metaphysical studies that you find fascinating and that you'll want to relate to others. This information could trigger your own insights. Write down your ideas. You'll want to remember them.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|10|10|Some important plans, perhaps involving a vacation or education, could be temporarily blocked by circumstances beyond your control, Capricorn. This can make you upset and might even set your temper on edge. You may be tempted to take out your frustrations on others. It would be more productive - and challenging - to find ways to make your plans work, even if they're delayed.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|11|A letter or call could arrive today bringing upsetting news about money, Aquarius. Your first reaction might be to blame yourself or someone else, but the circumstances are probably beyond anyone's control. Chances are it can be set right. Before anyone gets too upset, it's best to investigate and find out what needs to be done. It might take some effort, but all will be well.|Scorpio|Taurus|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|10|12|Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Pisces. This could involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless, so avoid it by doing some communicating. This is the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|11|1|Happy events involving a close female relative might have you feeling emotional, Aries. A marriage or birth could be involved. Your projects, particularly those with other people, could proceed well despite difficulties you've had to overcome. The results could move you to tears. You may feel the need to control yourself, but don't be afraid to show how you feel.|Aquarius|Leo|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|11|2|Your telepathy and intuition are at an all-time high today, Taurus. You should find it easier than usual to tune in to others' thoughts and feelings. It might be a good idea to control your reactions. Don't tell others what you're picking up unless you're sure they want to know. Your imagination and creative abilities are also operating at a very high level. Make the most of them.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|11|3|Today a deep concern for others' feelings could have you lending a sympathetic ear to those in need of some understanding. It's more important to listen than talk now, Gemini, even though your practicality might want to express itself. Your affairs should go smoothly, bringing you a lot of satisfaction. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears of joy at some point.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|11|4|Today you might complete a difficult project that's important to your career. Acknowledgement of your dedication and hard work could find you more emotionally overwhelmed than makes you comfortable. You may have to make a special effort to control your feelings. You've moved mountains to get where you are, Cancer, so it's nice to be recognized. You deserve to celebrate tonight.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|11|5|A long-awaited social event, perhaps a wedding or christening, could have you moved to tears, Leo. As you're naturally a person who doesn't like to show your feelings, you might need to be by yourself until the urge to cry has passed. This should be a very happy day for you as well, and your contentment could seem almost too good to be true. It's real. Relax and enjoy it.|Aries|Sagittarius|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|11|6|An intense, emotional dream could move you so powerfully that you awaken with the odd sense that the dream was real. Write it down, Virgo. Maybe it is. Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance in business could finally pay off. You could walk around in a daze asking yourself if it really has happened. It has. Make the most of it, and don't be afraid to show your feelings.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars

2016|8|12|11|Surprising news about your finances and the economy in general could cause you to feel confident and secure about your financial future, Aquarius.

2016|8|13|3|Does your job have a good profit-sharing plan, Gemini, or do you own company stock? If so, expect to hear that its value has skyrocketed beyond what anyone had hoped.

You might be a millionaire some day.|Aquarius|Libra|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|13|4|Romance should be going beautifully for you today, Cancer. Your romantic partner looks especially attractive and probably is in a great mood.

Also make sure you look your very best.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|13|7|Relations with family and other household members should be at their very best today, Libra. If you see colleagues outside of work, they could also be congenial and supportive.

It can only benefit everyone involved.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|13|8|Words of love could be exchanged between you and your romantic interest today, Scorpio. Obstacles to open and honest communication have been cleared away in the past few weeks. You'll both be more apt than usual to express your feelings. The only caveat is to not lay it on too thick. Even now, getting too mushy could be off-putting for your partner. Be discreet and enjoy your day.|Leo|Aquarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|13|9|Money matters should be going well for you now, Sagittarius, so today you might decide to make a long-desired expenditure for your home.

The results could make a very positive difference in your home life. Enjoy.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|13|10|You should look especially good today, Capricorn, and feel outgoing and charming. Friends, neighbors, and strangers may comment on how great you look.

2016|8|13|11|Your imagination should be flying high today, Aquarius, and your creative juices flowing freely.

Don't be surprised if you find your intuition increasing as well. Make the most of it all, and have fun.|Scorpio|Aries|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|13|12|A social event could take place today involving a number of friends you may not have seen for a long time, Pisces.

But this should be mostly a happy and gratifying day for you. Enjoy.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|14|1|Activities of some kind could put you in the public eye today, Aries. Some work you've done well might bring you richly deserved acknowledgement. Your energy and enthusiasm are already high, and you're probably all fired up to do more. This could bring up thoughts of changes in your working situation. But don't give notice right away. Some careful thought is needed.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|14|2|Changes to your chosen field are indicated, Taurus. Ideas from other states or countries might fire your creativity. Your intellectual or artistic interests could take on a new dimension, expanding your horizons and opening new opportunities.

2016|8|14|3|A sum of money above and beyond your usual income could come your way. This could be a bonus, settlement, or even a gift of some kind. You could put it to work making changes in your home, perhaps repairs, perhaps remodeling or redecorating. This may seem like a daunting prospect, but you'll have the energy and enthusiasm in addition to the money. Go to it.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|14|4|Some vast changes in your community could take place, Cancer. They're positive, for the most part. Today the news should spread widely, and you could be hearing about it from all sides - local newspapers, neighbors, and conversations on the street. The level of excitement in your neighborhood is likely high, and you could get caught up in it. Be prepared for some surprises.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|14|5|Leo, you might choose to do some volunteer work today or help a friend. This could make you aware of a talent you didn't know you had. It could pave the way to more income. You could feel very proud of yourself and decide to do more with this ability, leading not only to financial benefits but also to increased self-esteem. Go for it.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|14|6|Today you might wake up feeling that you can move mountains - and this might be exactly what you set out to do, figuratively speaking. Your physical energy, enthusiasm, and self-confidence are very high, Virgo. Your own and others' creative projects could take up a lot of your time. If you're coaching or helping others, however, avoid the temptation to take over the project.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|14|7|Today you could recapture the joy in life that you had as a child, Libra. You're serious by nature, and feelings of joy are to be lived and treasured. You could be experiencing true flow. There might not be any real reason for it, so don't try to find one. Your imagination and your relationships with others could be enhanced as a result. Relish the moment.|Cancer|Capricorn|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|14|8|Projects involving a group, perhaps your entire community, could take up a lot of your time, Scorpio. Interesting news and stimulating conversations could come your way. Expect a lot of activity around you. You could be running around in the car, seeing a lot of people, getting errands taken care of. You could also find yourself changed somewhat - for the better, of course.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|14|9|New ideas for your career could be on your mind, Sagittarius. You might be thinking not only about getting a new job but also entering an entirely new field. This could be a positive development, but don't be too impulsive and leap without thinking. List your options, cross out the unworkable ones, and do some research on the rest. Even though you may feel some urgency, there is none.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|14|10|Continued success and good luck should have you feeling charged up to move ahead with plans and ideas. Your energy and enthusiasm are high, Capricorn. You're likely thinking about expanding your horizons, perhaps through travel or education. You should definitely give these serious thought. Plan carefully, and take care not to move before the time is right.|Libra|Pisces|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|14|11|Don't be surprised if sometime during the day you feel angry for no apparent reason, Aquarius. It's probably rooted in the past, from a situation that wasn't resolved long ago. Take a good look at what's going on today. Did some person or event awaken old traumas within you? Let them and the anger go. This can only benefit you and clear the way for more positive emotions.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|14|12|This is a great day to start new enterprises with others, Pisces. Gatherings with friends or group activities could lead to ideas for new projects that fire your energy and enthusiasm. New immediate and long-term goals should be set. Some people may not be interested and could drop out, but don't worry. Others who share your interests will quickly step in to take their places.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|15|1|It could be scary for you to do anything risky for fear of conflict or failure, Aries. Perhaps you've tried to become invisible in different situations so you can avoid being noticed. These defense mechanisms may serve you for a while, but acting out of fear or guilt won't get you where you need to go. To achieve what you want, you must act with confidence, love, and faith.|Sagittarius|Leo|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|15|2|This is a terrific time to start some physical activity that takes you outside and gets your blood pumping, Taurus. Don't think this means you have to become the star player at a tennis club. A simple walk around the block every morning may be all you need to feel a boost in physical and mental energy. Note also the clarity of mind that comes when you get your body moving.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|15|3|You may feel like you're being tested in some way and must prove that what you're doing is valid and correct, Gemini. Fortunately, you should feel an emotional boost that will help you be confident about who you are, regardless of what other people think. The biggest tests are those that you give yourself. You are your toughest critic. Take concerted steps to go easier on yourself.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|15|4|You're able to assert yourself with more confidence than usual, Cancer. You should have a grounded perspective regarding your emotions. You aren't afraid to speak your mind in a situation where normally you'd only say anything that helps keep the peace. Other people may prefer that you keep things on an even keel, but you aren't working for them. You're working for yourself.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|15|5|Just when you feel like you've come to a point of emotional stability and calm, Leo, something happens to throw you off balance. You may be uneasy with the notion of stability and feel what you really want is risk, action, and excitement. This inner conflict makes it hard for you to operate. Try not to overanalyze every piece of the equation. The solution will come to you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|15|6|You have lots of energy and self-confidence, Virgo. That's wonderful, but it may also put you at greater risk for dangerous experiences and accidents. You could find that you're much more aggressive, especially if someone crosses you. An emotional irritation could manifest in physical ways like reckless driving or arguments with people who don't deserve your anger.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|15|7|Be happy with yourself and others, Libra. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends. By only seeing the bad in people, you may talk yourself out of relationships with them. Be careful about coming across as a know-it-all. It isn't your job to dictate or judge.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|15|8|You may be bursting with energy and yearning to travel, Scorpio. At the same time, your emotions could find a way to block these thoughts. You may feel like there's some sort of weight holding you down, making it difficult to act freely. This could cause you to act fitfully, leaving you frustrated and defeated. Calm down and take things one step at a time.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|15|9|You may feel a bit blue due to a nagging weightiness that pins you down to reality instead of being free to fly, Sagittarius. You may act out in an effort to prove to yourself and others that you're somehow above Earthly things. Get over the mental block that says being grounded is a bad thing. Plant your feet firmly on terra firma. That's how you find balance and attain your goals.|Virgo|Aquarius|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|15|10|You're able to work much more efficiently and effectively, Capricorn. Your energy is strong and you don't need to fight in order to get your voice heard. Attend to details and don't get discouraged by any discomfort that might arise. As long as you approach things with a positive attitude, everything should work out fine. You shouldn't have to put in any special effort to be successful.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|15|11|Different people measure success by different scales. You shouldn't get discouraged if your accomplishment today seems small compared to what others have done in the same period. Comparisons will make it difficult for you to feel like you're getting anywhere. Someone else will always do more. Be content with what you do today, even if it's something simple.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|15|12|You could feel as if the battle has begun and you're the target, Pisces. If you don't have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you're dealing with them when you're really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.|Scorpio|Cancer|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|16|1|Try not to let the blues get you down, Aries. While it's true some days can seem to drag, the busier you stay, the faster time will pass. Get down to finishing any work still pending and make plans for an evening out. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, not only will things seem to speed up but you'll also feel better knowing you're almost done.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|16|2|Dare to be different, Taurus. It's easy to fall into routines - sleep and eat at the same time, wear the same style, and do your work the same way every day. Before you know it, you're in a rut. The only way to pull out of it is to decide to break free. Try a new hairstyle. Wear colors that are new for you. If the rut is really deep, consider a new career. Expand your horizons.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|16|3|If your lifestyle is very different from others, resist feeling self-conscious about it today, Gemini. Remember that you chose your life for specific reasons. Even if you're considering a change, there's no need to feel ashamed or embarrassed about where you are now. Everyone has to make his or her own way. If it conforms to the norm, that's fine. If it doesn't, that's fine, too.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|16|4|Enhanced determination could motivate you today, Cancer, giving you the zip to plow through your work. Finish projects that have been pending and think about what you want to tackle next. Don't hesitate to do something that feels complicated or big. You'll probably be able to handle anything, and it will feel great when you're done. Making the most of any opportunity. Enjoy your day.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|16|5|Are you feeling the effects of today's low-key planetary aspects, Leo? Take heart - it's only temporary. Do your best to take things one step at a time, and make some plans for a little fun this evening. Get together with friends or see a movie. Help yourself feel better by staying busy and focused, followed by recreation. Before you know it, you'll be feeling much more upbeat.|Taurus|Scorpio|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|16|6|Make some plans for recreation, Virgo. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|16|7|Don't judge someone just because his or her lifestyle differs from what you consider normal, Libra. You may be traditional, but not everyone shares your view of relationships, work, or lifestyle. While this may seem hard to understand and even frightening to you, try not to be too hard on others. You'll be better off using that energy to keep your own life on track.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|16|8|Friends seeking advice or a shoulder to cry on may be plentiful today, Scorpio. And you're one of best people to provide the support and caring they need. Just don't give so much to others that you have nothing left for yourself. True friendship is about sharing problems. Getting rundown will leave you in a place where you aren't much help to anyone.|Leo|Capricorn|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|16|9|Getting through any work you have to do shouldn't be a problem for you today, Sagittarius. Even if you flag for a bit, you're likely to get a second wind, and this will give you the drive and determination to see your projects to completion. Make plans for some fun after you're done, such as getting together with friends or taking in an event that really intrigues you. You deserve it.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|16|10|Working within boundaries and restrictions could get to you today, Capricorn. Yours is an independent spirit, and your best achievements are often born of doing things your own way. Like it or not, we all have to follow rules. Finish what needs to be done. Afterward, you may find more freedom to act independently without consequences. Exercise patience and diligence as needed.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|16|11|Chances are that you'll feel upbeat and positive today. Share this energy with others who feel less than content. Your attitude can have a profound effect on friends, partners, spouse, and children. Neighbors and extended family can pick up on your spirit without you even realizing it. If someone is hurt or angry, be encouraging. Everything will eventually work out.|Libra|Gemini|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|16|12|Don't discount your excellent resourcefulness, Pisces. If you haven't got everything you need or all of the information required, take some time to think. Who do you know? What resources can you access? Who might know where you can find what you need? Rather than panic because the pieces aren't all there yet, make a list of contacts and go for it. Trust in yourself.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|17|1|Don't be surprised if you feel super today, Aries. Chances are good that you'll enjoy renewed physical strength, with energy to spare. It might be a good day to tackle any projects that require muscle. Perhaps there are household repairs that need tackling or furniture to move. You might want to go to the gym. Whatever the activity, this is a good day to go for it with gusto.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|17|2|The influence of the planetary aspects will bring an end to any lethargy you've been feeling, Taurus. It's an excellent day to head outside and do something active. Gardening or landscaping can make great use of your energy and creativity. Fresh air and physical exertion will benefit your health. Even if you have to work today, there's always the evening to enjoy.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|17|3|Take charge of your health today, Gemini. You'll likely wake up feeling energetic. Take advantage of the energy boost from the planetary movements to actively do things that maintain your sense of well-being. Consider emotional and spiritual aspects of your health. Sit outside in the fresh air. Take a walk, do some gardening, engage in something creative and physical.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|17|4|If you saw something in a craft shop or art studio that you'd like to buy but can't afford, consider making it, Cancer. Even if you don't think you're artistic, you could surprise yourself if you try. There are resources for novice crafters. They can give you the needed support and instructions. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche.|Aries|Libra|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|17|5|It's the perfect day to head outside, Leo. You'll likely be feeling positive and energetic, and the fresh air, sunshine, and physical activity may be long overdue. Even if this is a workday, make the most of your breaks and lunch hour by walking. This evening could be the opportune time to get together with friends.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|17|6|It won't be surprising if you're frustrated with a close friend or partner who's far less ambitious than you, Virgo. The energy in the air can emphasize your dynamic ways of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful may be difficult for you to understand. Yet people have to do things in ways that are best for them. Try to be patient.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|17|7|See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones to get group activities going today, Libra. You're probably feeling great, and the idea of socializing appeals to you.

Do whatever it takes to have fun and get some fresh air.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|17|8|If you lack a regular exercise routine, Scorpio, today's a great day to remedy that. Exercise doesn't have to exhaust you or hurt.

Find something that works for you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|17|9|"Put your ambition into action today, Sagittarius. The day's planetary aspects should find you feeling energetic and positive, so take steps to achieve your goals. Nothing will happen if you don't actively pursue them. The years can pass quickly. You don't want to be sitting in a rocker wondering ""what if."" Trust yourself and do what it takes. Everything starts with that first step."|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|17|10|Don't hesitate when it comes to taking on a project or making plans today, Capricorn.

2016|8|17|11|Today should go well for you, Aquarius. Expect to feel a renewed energy and fresher perspective, especially concerning anything work related.

When everything is taken care of, make plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|17|12|Today you may feel very creative and ambitious, Pisces. You might want to use this energy to work on an artistic project, or you may choose to channel it into such activities as organizing your home or workspace. If you plan for it, there should be plenty of time to do both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|1|You might feel cornered into doing something you don't want to do today, Aries. Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project. Maybe someone decides it's the day to call in an I.O.U. Either way, say so if you aren't comfortable following through. Today's energy enhances your ability to express yourself and be understood. Rescheduling may be far better than potential resentment.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|18|2|You might find that someone close to you needs a hand today, Taurus. They could be too proud to ask for help. Don't let that stop you. If you see a situation in which you can help, do it. Don't wait for an invitation or request. Simply assess the situation and do what you can. Your efforts will be appreciated and you'll feel good about making a difference.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|3|When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Gemini? The keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of writing's rhythmic motion is far more soothing and healing than people realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good. It unlocks places within that typing can't access. Try it.|Pisces|Virgo|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|4|Today could bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Cancer. Verbal communication is likely to be enhanced. Take advantage of this by talking through any problems or issues with important people in your life. Go to visit or call to work things out. Most importantly, express your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|18|5|Don't be surprised if your mind goes a thousand miles a second today, Leo. Slowing down will be difficult, and you'll have to find a way to express what's in your head. The planetary aspects lend strength to communication. Perhaps talking out your ideas or writing to someone whose insight you value will help. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|18|6|Welcome to another great day, Virgo! The energy from the planetary aspects is positive and encouraging, especially when it comes to communicating and interacting with others.

2016|8|18|7|You might be really interested in getting out and doing something with the special people in your life, Libra.

Pack up the family or friends, and go for a fun day to check it out.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|18|8|Scorpio, consider channeling your philosophical inspirations into creative writing, Scorpio. It's probably something you'll enjoy. Even if you haven't expressed yourself in this way before, there's no better day than today to give it a whirl. Try your hand at poetry or fiction. If that seems too daunting, start a journal. This will give you a place to collect your thoughts and insights.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|9|You might need to be alone today, Sagittarius. You're probably surrounded by people most of the time. It can be unhealthy if you can't occasionally be alone with your thoughts and feelings. It's critical to take care of your emotional well-being, since you have a deeply sensitive nature. With all the continuous activity around you, make time to connect with this important part of you.|Leo|Aries|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|18|10|Today you may want to go your own way regardless of what anyone else wants, Capricorn. Your independence is important to you, but compromise might be needed in order to avoid conflict. Consider splitting your time between those close to you and yourself. Explain to your loved ones why you need alone time. If it's done with grace and humor, they'll undoubtedly support you.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|11|Today may find you in the mood for an adventure or a visit, Aquarius. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? It's probably been too long.

Whether you invite a friend along or go alone, seize the opportunity to visit people or see someplace new.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|18|12|Serious thinking and communication are enhanced today, Pisces. They're already strong qualities in you, and with this added boost, you'll need an outlet for expression. A journal is an excellent vehicle. Talking is another. If you have issues or worries, consider getting together with all involved and airing your thoughts. It's a perfect day to resolve problems.|Capricorn|Cancer|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|19|1|You may feel a need to get moving today, Aries. Almost everyone at times prefers quiet activities, books, art, and even just sitting around to physical activity. But your health can suffer if you're too inactive. Fresh air, exercise, and sunshine are vital to your well-being. Don't resist the urge to get up and do something active. Chances are good that you'll really enjoy it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|19|2|Taurus, you'll probably find that you have a ton of energy to put into all kinds of activities. Finish any work that still needs completion, consider doing some cleaning and organizing, or see about getting out for a little warm weather fun. Whatever you choose, make sure it's active. You'll need a place for all that energy to go and quiet activities won't cut it today.|Aquarius|Leo|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|19|3|This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Gemini. The arts will more than likely be very important to you. You may find that nothing brings you more pleasure on days like this. Consider putting this to good use by painting, sculpting, or doing crafts. You'll find the perfect thing for you is engaging in art activities with a focus on giving.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|19|4|If you feel tired, Cancer, you may need to close your eyes and listen to soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so do your body and mind some good and just relax and listen to your favorite music. Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you feel you need to accomplish something.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|19|5|Today could bring some strong feelings, Leo. This may not be new, as you generally have a tendency to feel things deeply. Finding a way to express this could sometimes be tough for you. While you're creative, it isn't always easy to find the right activity to get you going. Visit a bookstore and look for some appealing craft or art books. They may spark ideas for expressing yourself.|Taurus|Libra|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|19|6|Virgo, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression, as are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of your style. You are uniquely artistic. Enjoy this gift today.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|19|7|You may find that today brings great physical strength and energy, Libra. You may want to do some really challenging, physical work. This is the day for it, so why not go to it? Do some yard work or clean out closets, cupboards, drawers, and filing cabinets. Consider donating items that you don't use anymore or plan a garage sale to make a couple bucks.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|19|8|Get into doing things today, Scorpio. Activities that require focus or creativity are supported. Your physical strength and energy will compel you to do something active. If you've been feeling tired or under the weather, this can put an end to it. Consider artistic projects that take strength, such as building something out of wood or carving. Make something special for someone.|Cancer|Pisces|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|19|9|"Your active side may really show today, Sagittarius. While you can be extremely focused on ""thinking"" work, you can also love keeping active and enjoy physical work. When you have a project like cleaning your home, you can be quick when you put your mind to it. This is a good day to get a lot accomplished. You'll probably enjoy it very much and bask in the satisfaction afterwards.
                
               "|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|19|10|If you've been feeling tired or sick lately, this will probably turn around for you today, Capricorn. Bouts of moodiness can be a real drain. Your emotional state has a pronounced effect on the way your body feels. Be sure to take care of your feelings as well as your body. If there are things that need to be worked out, do that now. The two really do go together.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|19|11|You'll probably be busy today, Aquarius, and this may suit you just fine. This can really work in favor if you have some tasks to catch up on. Being energetic, active, and productive is natural for you. In fact, when you have to sit too long you probably feel restless or anxious. You may fidget, too. If you find yourself doing this, go find something active to do.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|19|12|Today, Pisces, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially strong if you've solved a problem. You may find that others often try to change your decisions, but not today. Things are working in your favor and you'll feel new strength as a result. Follow your heart.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|1|Find new ways to expand your horizons, Aries. The web has an infinite number of resources and information to explore. Not only that, but your community and local colleges offer various courses to choose from. Think about what you'd enjoy learning - perhaps a new job skill or craft. Whether it's judo or Italian or woodworking that strikes your fancy, it's out there. Find it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|20|2|Step out of your usual role, Taurus. Doing this every now and then can add knowledge and expand your life. The day's planetary aspects favor such growth. Your willingness to walk a different path can give you far more than you imagine. Try something you've never considered before. Go to a new place. Change your desk around. See what you can discover about yourself and the world.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|3|Are you satisfied with your current career, Gemini? If not, start by making a plan. There are specific steps that you can take to give you the greatest advantage in the opportunities available. Consider visiting online career sites. There are wonderful articles and tips for the taking. Don't settle for less than you deserve. See what's out there and find a more fulfilling career.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|4|Don't fear change, Cancer. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have far more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant and lifeless. It wouldn't be long before you grew unsatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust in your versatility, too.|Aries|Virgo|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|5|Make your dreams valuable tools for insight, Leo. Back in the old days, great rulers believed so strongly in the insight of dreams that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights or random thoughts, you can gain a lot from them. Reoccurring dreams are significant and can point to something that needs addressing. Consider exploring this area.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|20|6|Follow your instincts, Virgo. Even if you have a tendency to listen more to your reason, put that aside. While your ears can hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the lines and provide you with a much bigger picture. If something sounds right but feels wrong, you'll be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|20|7|Feed your mind with new knowledge, Libra. Visit a bookstore or read some interesting information online. If you have more time, visit the library or explore courses that you might like. There is knowledge to be had everywhere you look, provided you're open to receiving it. People are often the best resource. Ask someone to explain something, if that's what you need.|Gemini|Aquarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|20|8|Try to see nightmares as safe ways to understand feelings, Scorpio. No one likes to experience them, and we'd sooner forget them once awake, the quickest way to ensure they don't return is to understand what they're saying. Fear, pain, and anxiety are the most common ingredients of nightmares. What frightens you? Do you feel insecure? Consider the questions and probe for answers.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|20|9|"Are you living your dreams, Sagittarius? Are you still in touch with them? The energy from today's planetary aspects can lend strength and encouragement to this part of your life. Take hold of the things you want most of all. Ask yourself, ""What do I want people to say about me when I'm gone?"" Get back on the road to a fulfilled life by taking steps toward your desires."|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|20|10|Today's a good day to check into advancing your career or education, Capricorn. The energy favors expansion and growth. When was the last time you learned a new skill? It doesn't have to be work related, either. If arranging flowers, skydiving, or proramming websites is something that appeals to you, go for it. Never stop looking for ways to expand your knowledge.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|11|Do you recognize your intuition as a valuable asset, Aquarius? Some people do and some don't. Which group are you in? It can be easy to trust more in concrete, factual reality than in the things you can't touch, yet your intuition can serve you more than you may realize. That gut feeling you experience can guide you toward greatness and alert you to danger. Trust it more.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|20|12|Use your creativity to make things happen today, Pisces. This doesn't have to take the form of a finished product. You can come up with new and innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust your ability to discover such things. You're known for your sharp thinking and creative abilities. Combining them can make you unstoppable when finding solutions to almost any problem.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|1|Expect an added boost of physical energy today, Aries. It's an excellent day to clean out closets. Exercise like yoga or walking will be most enjoyable. It could also prove to be well worth your while to look at your goals. Are you where you want to be at this stage of your life or are there changes that need to be made? Give your brain and body a good workout.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|2|If certain projects or tasks have seemed difficult for you to finish, today's energy will give you the zip you need, Taurus. The energy indicates that things will go well for you once you get started. It's a good time to meet with others to discuss business or other arrangements. Your increased communication and cooperative skills will make decisions easier than usual.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|3|You might feel more energetic than you have in a long time, Gemini. A powerful energy that increases your mental acuity and physical strength can really help you finish anything that's pending. If you managed to accomplish so much already that you have time to spare, it's fine to help others with their load. Be sure to put yours first, though.|Pisces|Leo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|4|If there's something you've wanted to take on, Cancer, today's the day. There's an increase in your physical and mental strength. Dispose of any insecurity or lack of confidence and take the steps to tackle a project or goal. You have an innate ability to make sound judgments and this is what you need to trust. Take steps to get what you want.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|21|5|If you've been feeling sluggish lately, this will be a welcome day for you, Leo. You'll feel a surge in energy that greatly increases your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to be outside for sports or a walk. Such things will direct your energy and give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you have more focus later. Make the most of this.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|21|6|Virgo, if there's something interesting that you've wanted to try, this is a great day for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, which are essential to you. You're highly artistic. Continual stimulation is required to keep your psyche healthy. Experience something new today, even if it's a walk in a new place. You'll get the adrenaline you need.|Taurus|Capricorn|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|21|7|With today's energy, you can take steps toward getting things in order, Libra. Tackle desk drawers, closets, storage rooms, or filing cabinets. When you create order, you gain a sense of peace and personal control. Mental organization, such as goal planning, brainstorming, or scheduling, will add to this, too. Do what you can to clean out as many mental and physical corners as possible.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|21|8|Today's energy can have you feeling ready for anything, Scorpio. Given your more radical approach, you may need to keep in check. Humanitarianism is part of your being, so if the pursuit of something you want hurts others, it would be a serious contradiction. Think through your actions before following through to ensure that you remain true to your ethical standards.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|21|9|Today might be a good day to take a second shot at something that didn't work out the first time, Sagittarius. Falling flat on your face can damage your self-esteem and confidence, but such things are part of life, and they really do add character. By going back into the ring, you ensure that you build courage and perseverance.|Libra|Aries|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|10|Your ability to find innovative approaches to things may serve you well today, Capricorn. Strong energy and mental acuity continue today, and you'll find that most things come easily. When approaching projects, take extra time to consider possibilities. Try seeing things from every angle. You'll likely find far more choices than you originally thought there were. Jot down ideas.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|11|If long-overdue work has piled up, Aquarius, today is the day to dig in. This is especially so for things you weren't able to handle yesterday. Fortunately, you have added strength and mental acuity. Things will go smoothly. Make the most of this energy by not putting off anything. The pile will just grow if you procrastinate. Do what needs to be done and you'll feel great.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|21|12|Don't worry about being productive today, Pisces. You might still accomplish more than you have in a long time.

If you're into a creative hobby, work on that, too. You'll find it rewarding.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|22|1|Don't dwell on your fluctuating moods today, Aries. Look at the larger trends and how positive elements are coming together in your favor. Stay optimistic and remember that you were put here for a reason. Respect and honor your values by staying in tune with yourself and the world around you. There's a profound power in your stillness, so cherish all moments of silence.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|22|2|This is your day to shine in all your glory, Taurus. There's no need to hold anything back. You'll find that you have a great deal of love to share. Your heart is likely to go to extremes today in order to prove its love, passion, and affection. Make sure that this energy that's so true to your core is appreciated and reciprocated by the people with whom you share it.|Aquarius|Cancer|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|22|3|Try not to lose sight of your own projects or desires, Gemini. There's a great deal of power and manipulative energy in the air today that could throw you off course if you aren't careful. Have confidence in yourself and don't back down if things get too confrontational. Take control of the car you're driving instead of just coasting haphazardly down the hill.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|22|4|Recharge today by getting outside and stretching your arms to the sky, Cancer. Be proud and courageous. You have the power to turn an unhealthy situation into a positive one, but first you must get rid of all self-doubt. If you don't have confidence in yourself, it will be hard for others to have confidence in you. Make sure you let the world know exactly where you stand.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|22|5|Difficult predicaments could arise today if you try to exert your will over others without having the most honorable intentions, Leo. It could be that you're using someone else's fear of you to control him or her. This doesn't make for a healthy relationship. Try not to snap at others. Make allies, not enemies, and you'll find that you will have nothing to fear.|Aries|Sagittarius|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|22|6|The fire within you is raging today, Virgo, and you should be careful how you wield this power. Be proud and triumphant. Walk with your shoulders back and head high. Freedom is important, but make sure that others don't interpret it as you not caring about a person or situation that's actually quite meaningful to you. Let your heart speak openly and honestly.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|22|7|There may be a great deal of fuss over something that seems quite insignificant to you, Libra. Try to see the beauty and importance of everything around you. At the same time, make sure you give yourself enough credit for being the person you are. Egos are apt to go through a bit of a transformation that will affect the way you react to the outside world.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|22|8|Things are coming to a critical point for you today, Scorpio, and you may find that other people openly object to your actions. It's OK to be a bit selfish if the situation is appropriate. Look at yourself in the mirror and be proud of the person you see. Try not to get lost in the group or think that your personal success and happiness depend on the success of others.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|22|9|Feel free to speak more loudly today, Sagittarius. You'll find that things fall into place more easily if you speak your thoughts outwardly and directly in the presence of others. Bring your internal power under your control instead of becoming a victim of the control games played by others. Your sincere heart is easily manipulated, so be careful that you aren't getting the short end of the stick.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|22|10|You should bask in a glorious splendor today, Capricorn. There's a great deal of power at your disposal. You'll find your ego is healthy, charged, and ready for the battlefield.

2016|8|22|11|Add more sunshine to your day, Aquarius. It may be time to stir up your inner passion and let it speak with greater confidence than you have been lately.

Stay true to yourself above all else.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|22|12|You'll find that your spark can easily turn potential energy into kinetic energy, Pisces. Don't underestimate the power of your words. Realize the profound impact they have on others and take responsibility for their consequences. Try to use them sparingly if you can. Speak half as much as you normally would, but make each sentence resonate twice as powerfully.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|23|1|Your emotions could be extra powerful today, Aries, although something may not feel as if it's sitting right. It could be a feeling of manipulation. Perhaps you've misjudged someone else's sensitivity and now they're working to get back at you in a subtle yet harmful way. Attend to your feelings and spend time alone if it helps you get more in tune with your emotions.|Capricorn|Gemini|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|23|2|Take hold of this day as if it's your own and use it to grow your dreams, Taurus. You'll find a great deal of power and dynamism in the air urging you to take the adventurous route.

2016|8|23|3|There's a fiery tone to the day that can't be ignored, Gemini. You may find that adjustments need to be made in your own plan of attack in order to get on the same page with other people. Don't worry if things don't go according to your plans. In fact, the best route to take is the one that wasn't even planned. Do something that you've never done before.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|23|4|There's an extra spark in your eye that people won't be able to ignore. Today's a good day to get your point across, because you'll find people more open and receptive to new things than usual. Speak with confidence and you'll go far. It's important for you to say what you feel. If you don't, others will find reasons to walk all over you.|Pisces|Scorpio|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|23|5|Take yourself on a mental adventure today in which you explore new aspects of your world. Discuss philosophy and religion. Get to the core of a matter that seriously interests you. Now is a good time to consider taking classes or engaging in some form of higher learning. Your emotions come from a point of great power and you should use this energy wisely.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|23|6|Today is your day, Virgo, so live it up! If it seems like things have been rather intense lately, don't worry, they're apt to lighten up quite a bit today.

2016|8|23|7|Be careful that you aren't acting in a way that you dislike in others, Libra. You could find that you're slowly taking on the traits of the people you despise. Lighten up a bit and put a smile on your face. If you continue to see the negative side of everything, it's likely that other people will only see the negative side of you.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|23|8|The day's general mood should fit quite well with your agenda, Scorpio. There's no need to fixate on the negative. Keep things light and upbeat and worry about the consequences later. This is the time to be adventurous and explore. Don't let anyone else tell you how to run your show. You have a strong will and strong opinions, so don't be afraid to express either.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|23|9|You may need a translator to get through to people today, Sagittarius. It could be hard to make decisions, but not impossible. Today's tip is to err on the side of adventure. Trust that good luck will pull you through if you take risks. You may feel unappreciated. Ask for help when you need it, but don't rely on others to heal you. Most of this work needs to come from within.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|23|10|Use your power resources today, Capricorn, as you have a great deal of dynamic energy at your disposal. You have the ability to transform and conquer anything now.

Now is the time to do things full force.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|23|11|You could be asked to make some spontaneous decisions today that you might not feel entirely comfortable making, Aquarius. You could feel you don't have enough facts to make an educated decision about what to do next. Realize that sometimes it's necessary to bite the bullet and make the best choice based on the knowledge you have. Be adventurous and trust your judgment.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|23|12|Emotionally, you may feel as if you're running up against a brick wall, Pisces. It could be that your first reaction is to drown your sorrows in drink. Escapism is only a temporary remedy. If things slam in your face today, use this as an indication that you need to take necessary action. Don't keep bouncing around from one thing to the next in order to avoid the obvious. Face the music.|Capricorn|Taurus|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|24|1|Inspiration is the word for today, Aries. Your creative talent should blossom and motivate you to work on wonderful ideas. This could involve music, painting, decorating, or cooking.

Make notes of ideas you don't use today to remember them later.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|8|24|2|Today your physical and mental energy should be operating at a very high level, Taurus. You probably won't spend much time inside if you can avoid it. Expect get-togethers with friends and colleagues, and some stimulating, animated discussions. You may want to go for a workout. This is a great day to go out in the evening, perhaps to a concert, play, or movie. Have a great day.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|24|3|Your intuition is likely to be very keen today, Gemini. Accurate psychic insights could come to you thick and fast. Your imagination is also strong, and you might come up with ideas to enrich your home, work, or anything else on your mind. Don't be surprised if you seem to know what others will say before they even think of it. Write down any premonitions to verify later.|Aquarius|Libra|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|24|4|Get-togethers with friends or meetings with a group should prove informative and enlightening today, Cancer, although some of it may be a bit perplexing. You may have useful information to share, but you'll probably spend as much time listening as talking. Your friends may have happy news. Don't be surprised if day's end finds you more tightly bonded than before. Enjoy!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|24|5|Today things could be rather hectic at work, Leo. You'll probably be very busy and happy with whatever results you produce. You could tire yourself out, so be sure to take occasional breaks, and certainly don't forget to eat. Don't be surprised if colleagues pay you a lot of compliments. In the evening, go out to dinner and unwind. You deserve it.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|24|6|Some new information about an interesting field could have you browsing the web and looking through books to learn more, Virgo. This could involve law, philosophy, history, or spirituality. You could find so much that you want to take notes or make a lot of photocopies. Don't tire yourself out, and try to keep track of time. You might miss dinner or get to bed very late.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|24|7|Today you might learn about new and creative ways to increase your income, Libra, possibly involving technology in some way. So much new information could come your way that you find it hard to keep track of it, so make sure you take note of where you found it so you can consult the source later. Your mind could be going so fast that you need to take a walk to clear your head.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|24|8|Social events could put you in touch with interesting people in intriguing professions, Scorpio. You might get involved in some fascinating conversations that provide you with a lot of useful information. Some of what you hear could be so bizarre that you find it difficult to believe. New friendships or groups could result from this interaction, so get contact information. Enjoy!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|24|9|A friend or colleague could recommend some books that you want to read right away, Sagittarius. Be sure you take breaks and rest your eyes from time to time to avoid eyestrain and headaches today. It's also important to remember to get out and go for a walk, weather permitting. Your body needs stimulation as much as your mind, and a walk will clear your head. Enjoy your day.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|24|10|Today your mind will be quick, insightful, and inspired, Capricorn. Your creative impulses should go a thousand miles an hour and ideas should pop in and out of your head like crazy. Most likely you'll want to drop everything else and write down all your ideas. Make use of this inspiration while you can, as it may come in fits and starts. You could be surprised by what you produce.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|24|11|Visitors could pop in and out during the day, Aquarius, and you'll be in the right frame of mind to enjoy their company. Expect interesting news and stimulating conversation.

2016|8|24|12|Don't be surprised if your inbox fills with email or your phone rings off the hook, Pisces. Friends, relatives, and colleagues could have great news and useful information. One or more of these messages could inspire you to send a few of your own or even pay some visits. Most of what you learn should be positive and exciting, although some things may be confusing.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|1|A powerful need to reach someone either for business or personal reasons could have you spending a lot of time on the phone that may come to nothing, Aries. You might call every place this person could possibly be, and this could prove frustrating. Your friend may be away. Leave a message or two and let him or her call you back. Find something else to distract you.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|2|Money matters could prove obsessive today, Taurus, as you might be trying to make an important purchase and need to revise your budget in order to do so. You'll be able to do it if you calm down and don't stress out. Be logical and methodical, and you'll probably accomplish what you want without too much frustration. Tonight, schedule a special date with a lover.|Capricorn|Virgo|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|25|3|Today you should be looking especially good and feeling particularly passionate and sensual, Gemini. This is a great day to buy new clothes, as your fashion sense is probably right on target. Racy novels and romantic movies may seem more appealing than usual. This is a great day to be alone with a love partner. Try to do this early in the day so there won't be any conflicts.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|4|Your imagination should be flying high today, Cancer. Words, images, melodies, or whatever your artistic media are probably popping into your head faster than you can keep track of them. Write them down, record them, or do whatever you can to remember them or you could very easily forget them. You don't want that to happen. Take time to do this no matter what else is pressing.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|5|Your financial goals are probably on the verge of becoming reality, Leo, but it might seem as if the few tasks remaining are too monumental to face right now. Don't fall into gloom and despair. Try to find some workable ideas to get these obstacles out of your way with minimal effort. Remember, there's always a way if you take time to plan. Good luck.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|25|6|Conversations with a friend whose good sense you trust could open your eyes to new career possibilities, Virgo. You might think about transforming your working life.

You'll probably be glad you did.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|25|7|Strange dreams, insights, or visions could upend your spiritual orientation, Libra. These new ideas could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour and shake up concepts that you've embraced for most of your life. Think about it without making yourself crazy. What you're receiving is nothing more Earthshaking than information to consider and then accept or reject.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|25|8|A friend you may not have seen for a while could awaken strange new feelings for which you're unprepared, Scorpio. You may see this person as a potential romantic partner. What you do about it depends on your situation. It probably isn't a good idea to pursue this attraction today. It may pass. Wait a few days. If it's still there, who knows?|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|9|The formation of a new business partnership might transform your working life, Sagittarius. The benefits may not appear for a while, so don't quit your day job. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth considering. Make sure you have all the facts before making any formal commitment. It's important to be aware of every possible contingency before you start a new enterprise, especially now.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|25|10|Unfinished job tasks might have you wanting to pitch in and get them done no matter what it takes, Capricorn. This is likely to earn you a few brownie points with your colleagues, but take care that you don't stress yourself out. You probably woke up feeling pretty good this morning, but you won't finish the day that way if you exhaust yourself. Pace yourself.|Scorpio|Pisces|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|25|11|Today you're apt to feel very sensual and passionate, Aquarius. Sexy clothes, racy novels, and romantic movies could be more appealing than usual. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from strangers. This is an excellent day to schedule an evening alone with a lover, although you might not be able to get together tonight. You'll enjoy it whenever it happens. Better late than never!|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|25|12|A powerful desire for a current or potential romantic partner might come over you today, Pisces. This person could live far away or be on a trip, so you might have to be satisfied with a phone call or email instead of the meeting you'd prefer. Don't get frustrated. Distract yourself with an exciting novel or movie and look forward to when you can get together.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|1|There's apt to be powerful aggression today that may leave you feeling like you want to declare war on everyone, Aries. You may get the feeling that everyone else is completely nuts and you're the only one who really knows what's going on. Beware of misinformed people and false information. Fights could erupt over facts that seem true at first but are just someone's misguided dreams.|Sagittarius|Leo|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|26|2|You may run into some tension today as fantasy gets in the way of your plan of attack, Taurus. Keep in mind that things are moving rapidly these days, and the slightest movement is magnified. Don't try to undo things that can't be undone. Accept your mistakes and move on. There's a whole world for you to explore and conquer, so try not to get trapped in your own little box.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|3|You may run into a great deal of frustration if you try to fight the current circumstances, Gemini. The key is to take whatever situation you're in and make the best of it. Whining and moping about your position won't make things better. You have great gifts to be proud of and thankful for, so don't throw them away by thinking that they have no outlet. Create your own reality.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|4|Keeping things in balance today might be tricky, Cancer, since your instincts may gravitate toward a loving, fanciful, peaceful situation. There's a harsh, warring force working against this position. Beware of this powerful energy that's self-centered and courageous. Stick with the things you know and don't stoop to another's level if it doesn't sit right with you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|26|5|Things may be tough and aggressive today, Leo, but that doesn't mean you can't make progress. There's a nervous energy in the air spurring people to action. Keep in mind that you're likely to get caught up in the frenzy and be called to take a stand. Be careful that your viewpoint doesn't become fixed and stubborn. You can learn some valuable lessons by listening to others.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|26|6|Make sure that the battle you fight today is yours, Virgo. There's a great deal of tension in the air that might erupt when you least expect it. It may behoove you to stay detached from the war that's apt to ensue. Keep things light and try not to take things too seriously. Your philosophical viewpoint and strong spirit are the very combination needed to resolve the situation.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|26|7|Wake up on the right side of bed, Libra. This will set the tone for the rest of the day. Keep things positive and you'll find that the aggressive energies of the day work for instead of against you. Don't try to fight people who are so obstinate that they refuse to see another perspective. At the same time, make sure you stay open to other people's points of view.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|8|You may feel a strong connection with your fanciful, romantic side today, Scorpio. Dreams and illusions are apt to enter the scene and take you into the clouds. Be careful, because you might find that a strong aggressive force opposes these dreams. Your wit and connection with new technology and electrical gadgets will be your greatest assets on a day like today.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|26|9|Give people the benefit of the doubt today, Sagittarius. Even though you may not agree with everything going on around you, people have their reasons for the way they act and the way they are. This doesn't mean that you need to act in exactly the same manner. Stick to your routine and don't get thrown off track by the aggressive warrior in others.|Libra|Aquarius|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|26|10|Some action you took yesterday may be opposed today, Capricorn. Unclear facts and romantic fantasies could get in the way of your taking decisive action. You may feel the need to act anyway. Keep in mind that communication could be tainted by pockets of uncertainty. Try not to rock the boat. Today's energy is a delicate balance between war and peace.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|11|If you find yourself in a slump today, Aquarius, don't worry. It could be that nothing fits right or that a certain nervous, restless energy urges you to take action but uncertainty prevents you from knowing which way to turn. This combination could result in a locked-up feeling that keeps you incapable of any movement at all.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|26|12|Use the day's boisterous energy to take charge and make things happen, Pisces. You'll find that actions you take today resonate in the coming days. Don't worry about the consequences. Simply go for the gusto. Strong forces are at work encouraging you to seek freedom in your creative endeavors and giving you more room to explore your inner sanctuary that you hold so dearly.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|1|Things will be extremely light and airy today, Aries. You may find that people are a bit less sensitive than you. Moving out of your comfort zone is the key to growth. Don't hesitate to move into the unknown. You can achieve a greater sense of balance between yourself and your environment if you're open to change and accept it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|2|The wind is blowing briskly today, Taurus, helping you keep your internal fire burning bright. You'll be a social butterfly today. Your energy may be scattered, but this can actually work to your advantage. Picking up tidbits of information and hints from different places and people will help you integrate your energy with your environment. Capitalize on this exciting energy.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|3|The key for you today is to not take things too seriously, Gemini. You'll find that the more you deliberate over a decision, the harder it will be for you to make. You may miss your opportunity while you're weighing the facts. Be spontaneous. Try something you've never tried before. Vary your experiences so things don't get boring. Variety is the spice of life.|Aries|Libra|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|27|4|This is a terrific day for you, Cancer, and you'll find that long-term trends are moving in your favor. Your sense of discipline combined with a little bit of luck is setting the stage for you to perform. The audience is waiting anxiously and you have a great deal of humor, knowledge, and happiness to share. Engage in witty conversation and remember that life is an easy flow.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|27|5|It may be necessary to hire a translator in order to get through to people today, Leo. You may find that the more adamant you become, the more people shut you out. Keep things light and energetic. Too serious a tone could lead to disaster. Try not to make things more complicated than they need to be. You're holding the right cards, and now it's time to play them strategically.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|27|6|A great deal of wind fills your sails today, Virgo, so set your course for a long-distance trip to an exotic place. Things are coming to a dramatic climax right now. You could find that some serious pieces of your life are taking a dramatic turn. Change is necessary for growth. If tension exists in certain areas of your life, don't fight it. Think about taking a different path.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|7|There's a lighthearted, whimsical quality about the day that you might not appreciate at first, Libra. You'll find that the more open and accepting you are of this energy, the more you can make it work positively for you. Use this feeling to balance the seriousness in your day. Don't get caught up in unnecessary drama that has nothing to do with your situation.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|27|8|You can probably sweet-talk your way in or out of any situation today, Scorpio. You have a great deal of power within, and you can accomplish anything as long as you aren't afraid to use it. Don't fear failure. If you never try, you'll never succeed. If you see missing pieces in the plan, don't worry. Trust that things will fall into place as needed. Keep your eyes on the prize.|Virgo|Capricorn|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|27|9|Find comfort in the people around you today, Sagittarius. Try not to take things too seriously. Don't feel like you need to internalize everyone else's problems. Take a step back from any situation that doesn't seem right to you. You may find conversation with new people to be extremely stimulating and rewarding. Keep your guard up, but don't let it block you from new experiences.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|10|Someone has just turned the fan up high, Capricorn. There's no lack of air to fuel your fire. Information is flying left and right and there's a lot of opportunity associated with it. To take advantage of this powerful day, keep the air circulating around you. Stretch and take deep, powerful breaths to enhance your nervous system and make the best use of this energy.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|11|The time has come for you to be more flexible in your approach, Aquarius. Things are changing quickly, and if you aren't prepared to change with them, you'll be left behind. Be aware of the fluctuating atmosphere around you, and be prepared to make the necessary internal adjustments that help you fit in better with the external environment. Don't fear change.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|27|12|This is a wonderful day for you, Pisces. You'll find that you're holding all the cards you need to be successful.

You'll find that the more in tune you can be with yourself, the better integrated you'll be with the people around you.|Capricorn|Cancer|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|1|Today you wake up feeling reinvigorated and renewed, Aries. You feel as though you can accomplish anything. And very likely, today you can. Anything you set your mind and attention to works out beautifully. Take care that you don't gloat too much, though. Just because you feel invincible doesn't necessarily mean that you are.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|28|2|People often see you as shy and reserved, Taurus, but of course you know that you're really very friendly once you relax. Today you find it unusually easy to interact with others. In fact, you feel downright gregarious as you chat and joke along with the best of them. This new, sociable you does wonders for your image. You've needed to loosen up for some time.|Pisces|Virgo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|3|All things domestic are highlighted, Gemini. It could be that you've finally called the plumber or set out to do those household repairs yourself. New people are likely to come into your life. In fact, they may appear at your doorstep to finagle an invitation for dinner. All you can expect today is the unexpected. Have some extra food on hand and see what happens.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|4|Keep your mind open to any and all possibilities today, Cancer. It's likely that you'll encounter someone who imparts valuable information. You may not realize right away just how important this information is, but it could have a dramatic impact on your life. Be prepared for anything. This is likely to be a most interesting day.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|5|Your ship could come in today, Leo. It will happen unexpectedly, and it may take you some time to adjust to this sudden financial windfall. This is a day of big changes, because you may also decide to use this money to completely alter your way of life. It could be that you make a move to another part of the country or decide to change professions. Trust your instincts, Leo.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|28|6|You're likely aware of your writing abilities, Virgo, but you may not realize the extent of your talent. It would be worthwhile to devote more time to your craft. You can't improve much if writing time is interrupted by other obligations. Take some time to produce something of value. Why not give it a try, even if just for a week or so, to see what you can do?|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|28|7|"Tact isn't necessarily your strong suit, Libra. No one would accuse you of being overly sensitive to other people's emotions, but today you turn over a new leaf. This ""new and improved"" you tunes in to the thoughts and feelings of others and responds in thoughtful, caring ways. You may be surprised at how effective this gentler touch can be."|Leo|Sagittarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|8|If you aren't getting on a plane today, Scorpio, expect to in the near future. Your wanderlust is back and you're bound for the wild blue yonder yet again, most likely to someplace exotic. Enjoy the time away, but do come back. It seems that sometimes your spirit of adventure dampens your enjoyment of the more mundane but more real daily life.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|28|9|"Positive change rarely happens without effort. Keep this in mind as transformation occurs quickly. You may feel as though you're in the middle of a whirlpool and getting sucked deeper and deeper, unsure of where you'll ultimately end up. This is merely the ""nose to the grindstone"" phase. Trust that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded."|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|28|10|You have natural leadership abilities, and today would be an ideal day to make use of this talent. In the past you may have hesitated to step forward and implement your ideas. But recent successes have given you the necessary confidence to pursue your objectives. You'll likely find that the higher-ups support your efforts. Make the most of today's auspicious circumstances, Capricorn.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|28|11|Today you feel in control and on top of the world. You can do anything, Aquarius. This would be an auspicious time to begin a new project or creative endeavor. You can't help but succeed, but take care not to get in your own way. Sometimes you can be your own worst enemy. Believe in yourself and move confidently in the direction of your dreams in order to make them come true.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|28|12|Friendship could turn into romance if you aren't careful, Pisces. A platonic relationship could turn passionate, and no one would be more surprised than you. Think carefully about where you'd like this to go. While it can't go back to the way it was, you can stop it from progressing further if you're uncomfortable with the new dynamic. You can only make this decision once.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|1|Today your creative impulses could seem blocked, Aries. You might be trying to reach your own or someone else's deadline. You may feel the need to get some work done, while your muse seems to have gone on vacation. If your deadline is official, phone whoever's in charge and ask for an extension. You won't be happy with the results if you force yourself to work today.|Aquarius|Leo|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|2|A friend who planned to come over tonight might not show up, Taurus. You may worry, since this person isn't one to blow you off. Don't imagine accidents or disasters. The culprit's probably traffic. Phone your friend. If you don't reach him or her, leave a message to call you. Your friend is probably fine, but you may have to postpone your visit for another day.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|3|Travel of any kind might be virtually impossible today, Gemini. Airports could be jammed, flights delayed, and planes plagued with mechanical problems. If you're traveling by car, expect road construction and backed-up traffic. Stay home if you can. If you must travel, take plenty music and books to keep you occupied while you're waiting. You're likely to go nuts otherwise.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|4|This isn't a good day to invest in anything. Don't spend much time working on speculative projects, Cancer, and don't put your money into anything but gold, land, or blue-chip stocks and bonds. You probably wouldn't lose everything, but it would be a long time before you saw a profit. Concentrate on what you know is secure now. There will be better days to wheel and deal.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|29|5|A love partner could be gloomy today, Leo. This might be the kind of day when no matter how many times you draw your mate's attention to the doughnut, he or she still sees only the hole. The glass is always half empty, never half full. Your beloved will probably be this way all day. Don't let it drive you crazy. Try to see the humor in it. That will help you, anyway.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|29|6|You tend to be curious, Virgo, and you're always trying to learn more about your many interests. But today you could be eager to research a subject but be unable to find any information about it no matter how many libraries or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only get frustrated. Watch some television. At least you'll get a few laughs.|Cancer|Scorpio|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|7|The need to attend to business or networking obligations disguised as parties could get to you today, Libra. You may have been forced to attend too many of these recently, and now there are even more coming up. You dread going to a place you don't want to go, eating food you hate, talking pleasantly with people you can't stand. Decline if you can. Life's too short.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|29|8|Your home could be empty today, Scorpio. Other household members may be away and you could find it depressing. Instead of enjoying the solitude, you could feel like the walls are closing in around you. The only answer is to go out for a while. Take a walk or visit some bookstores or antique shops. Don't go home until you're too tired to do anything else. Try to have fun.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|29|9|Someone close to you might be uncharacteristically silent today, Sagittarius. Something is bothering them terribly, and they don't seem to want to talk about it. You're willing to listen or help, but don't try to coax your friend into sharing. Use your intuition to sense what's going on and do what you can to alleviate the situation. Your efforts won't go unnoticed or unappreciated.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|29|10|Financial worries might come up today, Capricorn. You may check your bank balance and find that you have little money. This might come as a shock, because you thought there was plenty there. Before you panic, ask whoever's in charge at the bank to double-check the records. It's probably a computer error. It shouldn't take long to correct, and you'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|11|Today you might be so gloomy that you don't even want to get up. It might not be a good idea to stay home, however. Try to find some tasks to distract you. At some point during the day, get out in the open air and take a walk, preferably through a park and near water, if possible. You'll get the endorphins going and lift your spirits considerably.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|29|12|Any work today could require a higher level of concentration than you can muster, Pisces. You might lapse into daydreams, think about personal matters, and feel guilty because you aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing. On days like this it's best to focus on routine tasks you can do automatically. That way, your mind can wander. That's the only way you'll make it through today.|Scorpio|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|30|1|Are you getting along better than ever with a significant other, Aries? If so, it's probably because you're more attuned to what your partner thinks, feels, needs, and wants. You might fetch something before he or she even knows it's necessary. This can help you reach a new understanding of your beloved. Go with the flow and make the most of it. You'll be glad you did.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|30|2|Peace reigns in the home today. Members of your household could communicate with each other almost telepathically, Taurus. You might find it strange, but it shouldn't be surprising. After all, they've been living together for a while! It's good for peace in the home. They can sense and avoid whatever irritates someone else. That should give you some welcome breathing space.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|30|3|You could attend a social event today, Gemini, but you won't feel like talking. You could be content just to listen to what everyone else says, feel at peace, and enjoy the warmth, music, and company. You may have been spending too much time at home and could well need to get out for a while. Relax, sit back in your chair, and enjoy yourself!|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|30|4|Someone, perhaps a close friend or partner, could present you with a small gift today, Cancer, possibly a book. There might not be any special occasion other than your friend thought you'd enjoy it. This can bring up warm and affectionate feelings. You'll want to spend a considerable amount of time with this person. You may think it's rare to find someone so sensitive and kind.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|30|5|Your intuition should be keener than usual today, Leo, but right now you're apt to be more interested in historical figures, perhaps people associated with spiritual disciplines. Books on these subjects could not only be interesting but also informative. Insights you gain from reading about these people help increase your understanding of the present. Keep reading!|Gemini|Libra|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|30|6|Happiness reigns in the home, Virgo, as everyone seems to have reached a new understanding of one another. You could also experience a new sense of peace and quiet. Everyone is concentrating more on reading and working on their own projects and less on socializing. This could be a wonderful time for you. You're getting along with your family and the house is a peaceful haven. Enjoy!|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|30|7|Today you might attend a group event of some kind in your neighborhood, Libra, possibly in the company of a partner. You and your friend might take an active part in discussing goals for the group. You feel strongly bonded to everyone - your partner, fellow group members, even the community. It's a warm, fuzzy feeling that could stay with you all evening.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|30|8|Circumstances are changing regarding your professional goals, Scorpio. You may have been thinking about a change for a long time, but someone you meet today, perhaps in a social or casual situation, could provide the motivation you need to finally decide. This isn't just the result of outer changes. You've been changing inside, too. You aren't the same person you were when you chose your current job.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|30|9|You're probably good at applying your spiritual principles to the way you live, Sagittarius. You're especially good at it today, particularly when it comes to understanding others deeply. Relationships of all kinds will likely grow and improve, at least those that matter. Those that don't will disappear. This is a time of great outer and inner change for you. Make the most of it!|Libra|Aries|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|30|10|Capricorn, you're usually more outwardly directed, but today you might break that pattern. You could be in a contemplative mood and wondering about everything from metaphysics to philosophy to money to your future. You're basically feeling positive about life, but you might be at a crossroads now. It may take some serious thought before you decide which direction to go. Give yourself some time.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|30|11|Today you might crave the companionship of friends and lovers alike, Aquarius. You're probably in the mood for some good food, good music, and great conversation, and that's just what you'll get. Later you might spend time alone with a love partner, reflecting on recent conversations. Some of them might be worthy of deeper thought. Have a pleasant day and a wonderful evening.|Libra|Aries|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|30|12|You're feeling pretty strong now, Pisces. You're probably in fairly good health and your mind is sharp. You've outgrown some areas of your life that no longer seem what they once were. One of these could be your work. You could be considering leaving a job you took primarily for the money and going into a profession you really love. Do it if it works for you.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|31|1|You should be in a good mood today, Aries, but don't be surprised if some aggravating force steps on your toes or pulls your chain in some way. More than likely, there isn't much you can do about the situation except grin and bear it. Do your best to maintain your position and don't lose self-confidence just because someone else isn't in tune with how you handle your affairs.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|31|2|Your aggressive nature is strong today, so be careful, Taurus. Even though this may be good for getting things done and tackling any project you need to complete, the problem is that you might have a tendency to step on other people's toes in the process. Be considerate of others' emotions and try not to get upset if someone else takes the spotlight for a while.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|31|3|It's probably in your nature to want to include everyone in your plans today, Gemini. Perhaps you're running around making sure everyone is being cared for. More than likely, your nurturing instinct is coming out, so feel free to spread this love around. Be careful not to sacrifice too much of yourself as you do this.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|31|4|You may find that you have a strong will now, Cancer. Once you get fired up to go somewhere, there's little chance that anyone can stop you. People may accuse you of being lazy or wanting to take the easy way out, but it's different this time. You should feel fired up and ready to move. The only thing that could get in the way might be someone's oversensitive emotions.|Taurus|Virgo|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|8|31|5|Calm down today, Leo, and be careful about accusing someone of something when you don't have all the facts. Keep your wrath under control. If you strike out now, you may find that you lose their respect forever. There are no guarantees on a day like today. If there are conflicts that you need to work out, at least make sure that it's done in private.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|8|31|6|You may be feeling a bit more in touch with your warrior side than your emotional side today, Virgo. More than likely this will set the stage for conflict in your world of hopes and dreams. Be careful that you aren't too aggressive toward people who are just trying to help you. The danger here is that you're most likely to hurt the ones closest to you. Be careful.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|31|7|You may find that someone or something is thinking or working opposite to the way you are, Libra. This feeling is aggravated even more by a strong warrior force that wants to be recognized. There is definitely a squeaky wheel in the situation that desperately needs oiling. Take care of the basics first before you try to deal with the particulars of a certain situation.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|8|31|8|Pay attention to your body today and feel free to stop when your body says to stop, Scorpio. There's a strong aggressive force asking you to take action in one way or another. Make sure that you are considerate of others. Most importantly, make sure that you are considerate of yourself. Don't indulge in cheap thrills at the expense of your physical well-being.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|8|31|9|Emotionally, you should be doing well today, Sagittarius. But when it comes to taking action, you're apt to be indecisive. Every option seems to looks fantastic. You probably aren't going to want to miss out on anything. The best thing for you to do is try to get a piece of everything. There are many pies to dip your fingers into. Why not taste them all to see which one you like best?|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|8|31|10|There's tension in the air today, Capricorn, and you might be restless and anxious to start something. There is plenty of energy around to feed you, but the trick is to make sure that you're doing things for the right reasons. Don't do things out of guilt, fear, or regret. Keep on the best path for the best reasons for the best results.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|8|31|11|You're probably feeling more in touch with your emotions, Aquarius, but it might be difficult to know which way to move based on where you are. There's an element of aggression in your world today that might aggravate your heart, making it difficult for you to get a grip on your situation. Try to calm down and focus before making any major decisions.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|8|31|12|You may be focused on a certain trajectory, Pisces, but today you could run into complications based on overlooked issues. Be aware of the people around you and how your actions affect them. You don't necessarily need to change your direction, but you might need to make a couple modifications along the way in order to keep everyone happy.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|1|This could be a particularly stressful day, Aries. Your workload is heavier than ever, thanks to the increased responsibility you've taken on. The day seems endless, yet there aren't enough hours to get done all that needs doing. Take care not to take your anxiety out on others. If you're nice to them, they may even help you finish your project!|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|2|Your self-confidence may be a bit low and you could doubt your abilities right now, Taurus. Don't get depressed or disheartened. Your skills are excellent. Try to look at your situation objectively and pinpoint why you aren't progressing in your career as rapidly as you'd hoped. You may be worried about money, but know that everything will work out in the end.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|1|3|Today you may feel bored and frustrated with your life's direction, Gemini. You feel buried under responsibilities, with no time left to do what you really want to do. You have other interests to pursue but no time to pursue them. It's frustrating. You might want to rethink your priorities. If you're creative about time management, you'll be able to find some time.|Aries|Leo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|1|4|You're less optimistic and energetic than usual, Cancer. Your mind feels sluggish - your whole body does, in fact. You're either coming down with the flu or completely and thoroughly disheartened. This would be a good day to take some time off. Issues from the past may come back to haunt you. Perhaps you should address them once and for all.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|5|You may be discouraged about money matters today, Leo. Perhaps a raise you'd been hoping for didn't come through. Perhaps a professional project didn't work out as you expected. Now is the time to put your ingenuity to work and figure out a way to earn the money you need. Trust that you have the necessary know-how. A good opportunity awaits you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|6|If work is beginning to feel more like a burden than a joy, it may be time to rethink your job, Virgo. Your personality is such that you need lots of room to stretch and grow. If you feel stifled, you know it's time to find a new professional challenge. You're fortunate that your skill set affords you many opportunities. Choose carefully!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|7|You're especially in tune with the environment and the people around you today, Libra. Such sensitivity is new to you, and you aren't exactly sure what to do with the myriad messages that come into your head, seemingly out of nowhere. Even though this is outside your usual experience, try to accept rather than analyze.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|1|8|You're drawn to public service, Scorpio. This desire propels you to volunteer your services with a group of some kind. You may feel a bit awkward at first, but your natural leadership abilities will soon kick in. The group will be left wondering how they ever managed without you. Your talent shines through once again. Well done!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|1|9|Don't take everything at face value today, Sagittarius. Information you receive might not be accurate. Someone could be repeating gossip or even creating it just to have something to talk about. Don't take part in the discussion. Since your workload is likely heavy, forego the socializing in favor of finishing the tasks in front of you.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|1|10|You may be feeling a bit on edge today, Capricorn. Your self-confidence is shaky and you may feel in need of new challenges. The tedious tasks you have in front of you don't inspire your imagination or creativity. Do what you can to get through this difficult day. Be extra kind to yourself by indulging in a good lunch or listening to classical music.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|1|11|You and your mate may be experiencing some differences of opinion. It seems you each have definite ideas about some of life's fundamental values and they aren't completely in sync. Make an extra effort to communicate, Aquarius. You may find that your values aren't as far apart as they first seemed. This rift between you will soon close. Hang in there.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|1|12|It isn't exactly all lightness and harmony at home today, Pisces. There's tension in the air and it manifests in silly family arguments. Try to arrange separate activities for siblings, and encourage your partner to eat out with friends. This is a day to give everyone his or her space. Tomorrow everyone will be happy to eat together again.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|1|There may be a damper on your mood today, Aries, especially in the morning. It could seem as if everyone is having fun but you. Having a good time is more a state of mind than anything else. Try not to get trapped in a lousy mindset. Late afternoon is a good time to ground your emotions. Operate from a point of stability instead of jealousy.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|2|2|There may be some conflict today, Taurus, especially in the morning. Your general mood is quite good, but there's a strong force asking you to be more realistic in your approach. The last thing you want is for someone else to throw a bucket of water on your raging fire of fun, but this is likely to happen unless you address the reality of the situation.|Pisces|Cancer|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|2|3|Your mind may be a little cloudy most of the day, Gemini, and you could find it hard to ground yourself. It may be that you're trying to navigate by the stars, but unfortunately, the clouds have moved in and there are no reference points to be seen. The good news is that the skies should clear later, and you'll find there's nothing but smooth sailing for the rest of the night.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|4|Praise you may receive this morning could make you feel on top of the world, Cancer, but try not to let this feeling go to your head. Stay modest despite the lavish praise that may be showered on you. By evening, you won't be able to get by on just talk alone. Actions will speak much louder than words and it's important that you have some sort of plan.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|5|Things should improve for you as the day progresses, Leo. The key is to stay loose and not be concerned with the situation's outcome. The future is uncertain. You shouldn't depend on something that may or may not pan out the way you want. There could be some conflict between you and someone with a strong ego in the morning, but this should resolve itself by evening.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|6|Your emotions could feel restricted today, Virgo, a feeling that may be difficult to shake. Take this opportunity to calm down and relax. You'll enjoy the good times more when you give your body the rest it needs. Always pushing for bigger and better adventures may be fun, but it can leave you too tired to fully appreciate them.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|2|7|It could be hard to find your footing early in the day, Libra. You may be better off sleeping in. Have a good breakfast and relax in the morning. By evening, you'll be refreshed, recharged, and ready to take on the town. Your emotions may feel restricted, which could make it difficult to fully express yourself. You'd be better off turning this energy inward now.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|2|8|Use the morning to take care of yourself, Scorpio. You could be so concerned with the world and the shared environment that you forget to take care of you. Use the early afternoon to reflect and meditate. Gather facts from your inner state and use the information to create a plan for the future. Be flexible in your approach.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|2|9|Get to some water today and reconnect with this element, Sagittarius. Like lapping waves against the shore, you may be gently changing the landscape around you with each word or action. Don't underestimate your inner strength. It could be that you seem overpowered by the things going on around you, but don't let them keep you from being the person you truly are.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|2|10|Emotionally speaking, you should be doing quite well today, Capricorn, especially in the morning. This is a good time to take charge of projects that require definite leadership. Don't think that you're inferior to the people around you. Act like you belong in a leadership role and you'll find that others will automatically support you in that position. You have what it takes to lead.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|11|You may get frustrated today, Aquarius, especially in the morning when other people's egos seem to be strong. It could be difficult to relate to people who simply refuse to accept any opinion but their own. Things should mellow out by afternoon. You'll find people start to see things from your perspective. Remain confident in your position despite the vacillation of others.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|2|12|People may see you as the personification of drama, especially this morning, Pisces. This is a good time to express your emotions and get things out of your system. Be sure to release whatever pent-up emotion you have inside. By afternoon, it might be a good idea to settle down and lay low. Turn your energy inward, come to your center, and plan what needs to get done.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|3|1|Don't expect to spend a lot of time at home today, Aries. You're more likely to be in the car and away from home. There may be errands and social obligations to fulfill. Try to pace yourself in whatever you do or else you might be exhausted by day's end. Take the time to stop and enjoy yourself. This will ensure a fun rather than tiring day.|Aquarius|Gemini|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|3|2|Emotional turmoil on the job could stress you out way too much. Headaches or temporary hypertension could plague you if you aren't careful. Don't push too hard. Remember to take breaks, Taurus, and go for walk on your lunch hour. Don't be afraid to put off nonessential tasks. You'll be all right. Why make a day's work any more difficult than it needs to be?|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|3|3|This should be a fortunate day for you, Gemini. Everything you try to do should go fairly smoothly. Relations with others are warm, friendly, and congenial. Any chores or other pending work should be completed quickly and efficiently. If you've been planning to start a new project, this is the day to get going. Romance should be intense and passionate now, so make the most of it!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|3|4|A couple you've known for a long time could visit you at your home today, Cancer. Don't be surprised if they tell you how wonderful the place looks. Conversation should be lively and entertaining, though you should sidestep any discussion of controversial subjects. Debates on such matters could get rather heated. It might be wise to treat your guests to food rather than alcohol!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|3|5|Today, Leo, you might spend a great deal of time in the car running errands in the neighborhood. You're likely to see people you know who have interesting news. New businesses may open nearby. Doctors, dentists, and other professionals could open new offices, making your daily routine more convenient. Some of them might be your neighbors or relatives.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|3|6|Money that you've been earning for a long time may finally come your way today, Virgo, but don't be surprised if you have to do a lot of running around in order to get it. Plans for future moneymaking projects could come up, although it's important to consider everything carefully and not jump in too quickly. This is an excellent time to learn a new moneymaking skill.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|3|7|The special someone in your life may be having some trouble with colleagues. Don't just comfort him or her, Libra. It's unlikely that your sweetie wants sympathy. Solutions are needed. If you don't have any, just be a good listener. It's important for you to get out and exercise. If the weather is good, take a walk. If not, attend an exercise class. You'll feel better.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|3|8|Today you're likely to be working hard behind the scenes, perhaps preparing a project for others to make public or coaching people for some kind of performance. You'll expend a lot of energy in the course of completing this chore, yet you'll probably feel it was all worth it. Don't expect to go home early, Scorpio. You'll probably go above and beyond the call of duty.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|3|9|Friends could entice you to join them for a short day trip, perhaps to the country. This is a great day to go on such an outing, Sagittarius. You've probably been working hard and need to get away for a while. Don't be surprised if there's a delay, however. You or one of your friends could be waiting to meet with someone.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|3|10|Emotions could be intense at work today as important projects approach their deadlines, Capricorn. You may put in more time than usual. Tempers might flare and co-workers clash, so stay calm and keep going. On the positive side, the financial and recognition payoffs for whatever you accomplish today should prove well worth the effort.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|3|11|Today you should feel especially sexy and relationships with romantic partners should go well, Aquarius. Your passions are intense, the lines of communication are open, and appreciation of one another is running high. There might be talk of taking a long trip together in the future. Plan a cozy evening for two. You'll want to do a lot of talking - and more!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|3|12|Money is probably on your mind now, Pisces. A desire for increased financial security could force you to look for work or investments that would pay off big. Opportunities for one or both of these are likely to come through friends, perhaps someone with whom you've worked before. You're likely to accomplish what you want for now, but it's uncertain whether you'll continue on this path in the future.|Scorpio|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|4|1|Unusual experiences may give rise to a new interest in the sciences or occult practices like magic or alchemy. This is an excellent time to start perusing such subjects, Aries, or embark on a formal study of astrology. A lucky money break could come your way today. It might be a gift or a repaid loan. Your inclination might be to go out and spend it all. Take care!|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars

2016|9|5|2|Flamboyant shows of emotions may not be as welcome as usual today, Taurus. Realize that you may need to put a damper on things in order to earn the respect of the people around you.

2016|9|5|3|There may be some tension today as you try to stabilize your emotions, Gemini. There could be a force at work out there that's rather impersonal and detached.

Stick to your tasks in a practical, grounded manner.|Aries|Libra|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|5|4|The tricky things to balance today are your emotions and sense of duty, Cancer. Try not to let the stress of having to complete a task leak into your state of mind.

2016|9|5|5|There's a practical grounding today that may cramp your style, Leo. More than likely you'll be aware of the time restrictions that point up your own limits.

2016|9|5|8|Put some of your fantastic ideas to good use today, Scorpio. It's one thing to be a genius with plenty of masterpieces floating around in your head.

2016|9|5|9|This is a good day to follow through on projects, Sagittarius. Leaving many unfinished matters in your life only creates clutter that keeps other things from entering the picture.

2016|9|6|1|You're intuitive by nature, Aries, and today you could almost be clairvoyant. Obey your instincts today. Don't let your rational mind get in the way. This isn't the day to be logical!

2016|9|6|8|Sudden and unexpected changes could have you feeling a bit confused, disoriented, and doubtful about the future, Scorpio. Relax!

2016|9|7|6|Interesting communications from friends could center on possible world developments or maybe some juicy gossip about people you know, Virgo. Enjoy yourself, but don't take everything you hear at face value. Much of it is less actual fact than the product of someone's fertile imagination. Short journeys in your area could bring news of upcoming changes in your community. Expect the unexpected!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|7|7|Today you might earn corporate kudos, Libra, for all signs indicate that your imagination is flying high and can be put to work to increase your job effectiveness. You might even earn a promotion or increase in salary. However, it's important to curb the impulse to hide the downside of whatever you're doing from those in power. Be honest! It will benefit you more in the long run.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|7|8|Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour. Ideas for imaginative and innovative projects may come faster than you can possibly turn them into reality. Write them down. You may not have time to work on them now, but you will later. You could decide to attend a lecture, sign up for a class, or make plans to join friends and attend another kind of group activity.|Cancer|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|7|9|You may have strange dreams and vivid premonitions today, Sagittarius. Your intuition and telepathic faculties are operating at a high level.

2016|9|7|10|Today you could be feeling warm and friendly toward everyone. You might be involved in social events or receive invitations to future parties.

2016|9|7|11|Relations with people on the job should be warm, Aquarius, and this could do wonders for your career. Take nothing at face value. All may not be as it seems. Someone has issues with you that render him or her untrustworthy. Take care to avoid getting too close to anyone who seems a little under the weather. Your immune system is a bit weak and you could catch a bug.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|7|12|Some new information could come your way that causes you to focus on a new interest, Pisces. It'll set your mind traveling to faraway places and times. You may also meet some new people who are highly educated, from foreign lands, or both. They might have fascinating stories to tell! Whatever happens, today promises to excite your curiosity and stimulate your intellect.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|8|1|A lover or close friend may seem to have dropped out of the picture, and this could have you worried, confused, and wondering if this person isn't interested in continuing a relationship with you. Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. The person has his or her troubles and will eventually want a strong, sympathetic shoulder to cry on. You're likely to be that person!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|8|2|Career interests may be short-circuited by gossip, rumor, and office politics. Someone has an agenda and isn't likely to care too much about the effect on others' lives of any underhanded dealings. If you hear about such goings-on, Taurus, do what you can to stop them before they get out of hand. That way you can protect your and your colleagues' career interests.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|8|3|Perhaps you've been planning a trip or a return to school for a long time. However, Gemini, a rather disturbing letter or phone call could jeopardize your plans and leave you teetering on the edge of disappointment.

You can take care of it without sacrificing what you want.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|8|4|Seemingly bad news about your financial situation could throw your usually even-keeled nature off kilter. Look into the matter carefully before panicking, Cancer. There may have been a computer error or other mistake, or perhaps someone confused you with someone else. Take steps to rectify the blunder. It's a drag, but you'll be relieved to know that all was better than it seemed.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|8|5|An unpleasant situation could arise. Your first reaction may be to protect those closest to you from the truth. You could be tempted to lie or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, Leo. Your desire to shield loved ones is understandable, but it could cause problems. You can't protect people from everything. Most people prefer to know the facts.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|8|6|Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour today. You might be inundated with new ideas and information that could cause mental overload. Write it all down if you can. You'll want to refer to it later. It might be advisable to then go out for a walk or other exercise. This intellectual overload could produce excess nervous energy that you'll need to work off.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|8|7|Worries over the situation of a lover or close friend who seems depressed could plague you today, yet you may hesitate to contact this person and ask what's wrong because you don't want to intrude. Nonetheless, you should. All is not as bad as it seems, and your concern will be appreciated. Tonight get some much-needed rest. You've been working far too hard.|Gemini|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|8|8|A family member may be depressed and not up for talking about what's wrong. His or her mood could spread to everyone else, so it might be a good idea to ask what's wrong. Point out that moods are contagious! Don't force the issue, Scorpio. That would be worse. A number of calls could interrupt your work, which you might find irritating. Don't be afraid to let voicemail get the calls.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|8|9|Misinformation might spread through your extended family or neighborhood and cause unnecessary upsets among those involved. Don't accept at face value any gossip or rumor you hear today until you check it out yourself, Sagittarius. It could turn out to be a tempest in a teapot. This isn't a good time to plan or take a trip of any kind. Delays or mishaps could result.|Libra|Aries|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|8|10|Misinformation regarding money could come from someone who has a stake in your believing whatever you're told. This could be a banker, creditor, investment counselor, or even a close friend or relative. Whoever it is, Capricorn, don't accept what this person says at face value. Look into the facts of the situation yourself before making any decisions about what you need to do.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|8|11|Someone close to you may not be totally honest. This person could be avoiding telling the truth or hiding something from you in order to protect you. Trust your instincts, Aquarius. If someone tells you something important that doesn't ring true, check it out before accepting one person's word. This isn't a vicious deception - only a protective one. But shielding someone from the truth can sometimes backfire!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|8|12|Weariness may have you feeling a bit listless today, Pisces, and you're likely to want to stay home in bed rather than go anywhere. This goes against your normal inclination, so you could be tempted to bite the bullet and get out in spite of your malaise. Don't fall into this trap. Get some rest so that when you absolutely have to go out, you'll be your old self again.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|1|Don't expect a great deal of sensitivity from others when it comes to issues concerning love and beauty today, Aries. People are apt to be in their own little worlds. It may be hard for you to relate to them now. Trying to sway others to your point of view could be possible, but it may be quite difficult and, more importantly, not worth the effort.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|9|2|There could be people who try to convince you that you're wrong about something, Taurus. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're inferior just because you don't agree with someone on an issue. Focus on your creativity today. You can combine your incredible artistic talent with pure intellectual genius for a dynamite swing that will knock any ball clear out of the park.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|9|3|There's an adventurous side to today that you should latch onto. Try not to get weighed down by the little things in your life that don't really matter much. Look at the big picture and understand the importance of having great breadth of vision. There's a whole world to explore out there, Gemini, so get going. There may be a few surprises today, so be ready for anything.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|4|Unexpected people and events are likely to crop up today just as you're longing for adventure. Feel free to hop aboard a train to an unknown destination, Cancer. It's better to regret the things you've done than regret the things you haven't done. Take this to heart as you plan your day. There's no shortage of fun out there - you just need to find it.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|5|It's extremely important that you not be too possessive today, especially when it comes to other people, Leo. You have important relationships with the people around you, and you'll find that in order to maintain them, it's best to let those people live their lives the way they want. Don't think that people belong to you, because they don't.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|9|6|Matters regarding love and romance are in your favor today, Virgo. You'll find that love comes to you when you least expect it.

A strong yet erratic urge may call you into action, so be ready to respond with your entire being.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|9|7|Realize that you might have to leave some things to chance today, because you probably aren't going to be able to control all that you'd like to under the circumstances, Libra. Although it may be comfortable for you to try to fit things into their perfect spots, you'll find that this may not be the best way to conduct your business, especially on a day like this.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|8|Things should be going quite well for you today, Scorpio, especially in the love and romance department. You'll find that there is a magical, adventuresome spirit when you connect with others. Take advantage of this courageous energy and put it to good use in whatever way you see fit. Bring an extra element of excitement into your world tonight with someone very special to you.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|9|9|Express your independence today, Sagittarius, and prove to others that you won't be pushed around anymore. Do things for yourself and have fun while you do it. Your heart will know which way is the right way to proceed. Don't be fooled by those who try to tell you otherwise. Success comes when you can initiate others into your world instead of you being seduced by theirs.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|9|10|Things relating to love and romance are in your favor today, Capricorn, although you may find that issues of this nature might be unpredictable. Lovers could be present one moment and MIA the next, but these are the risks you take when you deal with love. Find a balance that doesn't get you so wrapped up in someone else that you're hurt if his or her eyes turn elsewhere.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|11|It might feel like there's a hole in your heart today, Aquarius, and you could have a hard time filling it. Remember that you're the one responsible for making sure this void is taken care of. If you insist that someone else fill the gap, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Do something nice for yourself and feel free to spend a little money to make yourself happy.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|9|12|Issues regarding love and romance are at a climactic point right now, Pisces, and you could be rather combative. Your energy in this area may come in waves, and you're likely to be so charged up about the situation that you feel like a time bomb ready to explode. Don't destroy something wonderful by wanting a great deal more than you really need.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|10|1|There might be a lot of work to do at home today. Since certain family members are conveniently absent, you may feel that the burden falls on you. Don't be a martyr, however. Just do what you can and leave the rest. Uncertainties about money could also be on your mind, but put these aside for now. You'll be better able to deal with them tomorrow.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|9|10|2|Too much indulging may leave you with a headache or stomachache to the point where you may want to spend most of today sleeping. The stress of this condition could cause you to snap at family members, but remember that they weren't the ones who chose to overindulge. Chill out, get some rest, and regain your strength. You'll be back in the real world soon enough.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|10|3|You like to be honest with those you care about, but today you're likely to be a bit too honest. Don't be too quick to take offense, and watch the tendency to be too blunt. If you temper your honesty with some diplomacy, you should get your message across with a minimum of hurt feelings. You create win/win situations that way. It's best for all involved.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|10|4|It might feel like your home has turned into Grand Central Station. Lots of visitors, messengers, and others are going to drop by, and you may just want to watch TV or read a book. This could lead to some understandable irritation. However, be your usual polite self. If possible, get a family member to screen your callers. You might be frustrated, but you don't want to offend anybody.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|10|5|You might have to do a lot of running around when you probably want to stay home. Obligations to friends and family are likely to come up, and even though you're a bit tired you'll want to help out. The best plan for today is to get everything done as quickly as possible and then spend the rest of the day relaxing alone. You can have it both ways!|Aries|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|10|6|Don't be surprised if lots of visitors show up today. Perhaps you're hosting an impromptu social event or neighbors bring news of changes nearby. You should be brimming with energy, so you can handle it, but you might find it a bit unnerving if it gets too exciting. It's best just to go with the flow and enjoy situations like this. You can think about it later.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|10|7|You could be feeling a bit antsy today and may want to spend time exercising or trying a new sport or game that you've never played before. This is great. Ask some friends to join you. Don't push yourself past your limits. This can only bring exhaustion or injury, and it won't help your fitness level. Exercise within your limitations and do it more often.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|10|8|An exciting communication could inform you of an advancement opportunity that you should explore. While you'd be quick to act under normal circumstances, Scorpio, today you might be more cautious. You've sought recognition for a while, so don't be too reticent. Don't let your insecurity get the better of you. Learn all you can about the situation and then make an informed decision.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|10|9|A friend could ask for a loan and you might hesitate to give him or her the money. Follow your instincts. The person probably isn't too savvy about money. You might want to participate in some group activities, but don't let people take unfair advantage of you. You're willing to serve those who need you, but discriminate between those who do and don't really need your help.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|10|10|Today you're likely to experience a powerful burst of energy that may temporarily turn you into a workaholic. Chores may have piled up around the house that desperately need to be done. You may want to go through them like wildfire. You don't have to do them all at once. Take care of the most pressing tasks and then relax. The rest can wait. Ask family members to help.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|10|11|Frustration may be the word for today, Aquarius. You could be experiencing a bit of wanderlust. Distant states and foreign lands may beckon to you, but circumstances could make it hard for you to get away. There might also be friction with your partner. Don't get sucked into a quarrel. Use your placid nature to get grounded, then use your practicality to solve the issues at hand.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|10|12|You've probably had a busy week, Pisces, and may feel out of sorts today. Perhaps you had too much good food last night, stayed up too late, or both. It goes against your grain to stay in and rest, but this is the perfect day to curl up with a good book. You're going to want some exercise, but don't overdo it. As you well know, you can get too much of a good thing!|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|11|1|Romance is in the air today, Aries. It's likely that your relationship with your loved ones will see a dramatic improvement. Perhaps some flowers will arrive unexpectedly or you'll be paid a sincere compliment. Harmony reigns in the work environment as well. Both people and machines run smoothly and efficiently.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|11|2|You're focused and attentive to detail. Some longstanding projects benefit from this sudden spurt of energy and get completed in record time. Children figure prominently in your life right now, Taurus. Is there one child in particular who needs some extra attention from you? Your love and support mean a lot more than you realize.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|11|3|Don't let others' bad moods get you down, Gemini. And don't feel it's your responsibility to cheer them up. Their moodiness is their business, not yours. You could be a little bit anxious today, and allowing yourself to be negatively influenced by others will do you no good at all. The general atmosphere will improve in a few days.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|11|4|It's time to let go of the past and focus only on the future, Cancer. A new person may come into your life who can help you do just that. Communication with close friends and relatives is highlighted, and you may find yourself spending more time on the phone than usual. Enjoy this day as you anticipate your brilliant future!|Pisces|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|11|5|There's definitely a downside to home ownership! Much as you love projects, Leo, the joy is tempered when the chores never end. While your home is structurally sound, it may be in need of some cosmetic enhancement. Try adding plants and flowers indoors. Outside, a few strategically placed pots can act as attractive focal points. You can make a difference with little effort or expense.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|11|6|The glass may look half empty, but only at first glance. Keep looking at it, or perhaps change the way you look at it, and you'll see that it indeed is half full. You may be experiencing some frustration. Computers could be down or communication hindered in some way. Don't get stressed. See this as an ideal time to relax since you can't get any work done anyway.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|11|7|There are lots of personal and financial issues to resolve today, Libra. You may hear from your bank or see some alarming numbers on an ATM receipt. Don't get upset. Ultimately, these matters will be resolved to your benefit. As for personal matters, you may learn some new information about someone you thought you knew well. A relationship you once considered close may not be.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|11|8|A rising tide lifts all boats. When someone close experiences a windfall or especially good luck, Scorpio, the ripple effect reaches you. Change is in the air. While everything happening is positive, sometimes it feels like it's going too quickly. You feel a bit off balance, with little or no time to adjust. Even windfalls take some getting used to. Give yourself time to settle in to the new circumstances.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|11|9|It looks as though change is on the horizon at work, Sagittarius. You've just recently completed some long-term projects and are being recognized for your efforts. Perhaps a bonus or promotion is in store. Your affinity for technology and ability to quickly absorb new information makes you a prime candidate for a new position that's just opened up. Grab the chance!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|11|10|Crazy as it seems, why not take that impromptu trip you've been eager to go on, Capricorn? Adventure calls, and there's nothing to stop you from answering. You'll meet some fascinating new people, and one may wind up having a strong influence on your life. There is a great big world out there, so make the time to go and see some of it!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|11|11|Prosperity is just around the corner, Aquarius. With it comes change. Change in your job, career, or environment figures prominently today.

Savor this moment, for you'll be busy soon!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|11|12|Your world is changing, Pisces, both internally and externally. You feel a need to broaden your horizons. You may be contemplating a move to a new neighborhood or trip to a faraway land.

2016|9|12|9|Artistic talents are greatly increased by fresh, deeply felt inspiration. Today you may spend much of your time giving material form to your ideas.

2016|9|13|2|A household member might toy with the idea of moving out or going away for a while, Taurus. This could stress you out, but don't make yourself crazy. Don't try to talk him or her out of it. Listen sympathetically and let your relative get it out of their system. This person is probably feeling temporarily restricted by forces outside the home and isn't really likely to go anywhere.|Capricorn|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|9|13|3|Stress could have you feeling uncommunicative today. You probably aren't going to want to talk to anyone, even your dearest friend, Gemini.

Go to lunch alone, and tonight crash on the bed with a good book.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|13|4|Finances should be going well, Cancer, but your financial affairs aren't something you want to talk about to anyone now.

2016|9|13|5|You're likely to be in a solitary mood today, Leo, and probably want to spend the evening reading or working on a project of your own. However, it isn't likely to work out that way.

2016|9|13|10|"Something you might have wanted to keep between you and a few trusted friends could inadvertently be revealed, perhaps to the wrong people. Frustration and a sense of betrayal could plague you, but don't turn against those who knew. Even though this can be disconcerting, you can learn from it. Benjamin Franklin said, ""Two people can keep a secret only when one of them is dead."""|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|13|11|Demands placed on you by work colleagues could have you stressed, Aquarius. You might feel that your co-workers are taking unfair advantage of you.

2016|9|14|2|New beginnings and promising new opportunities may appear from a distant state or foreign country, Taurus.

2016|9|14|3|A financial windfall might open new doors for you, Gemini, and you could consider making some major changes in your life. You might think about moving to a nicer home.

2016|9|14|6|Have you been thinking about relocating, Virgo? The siren song of distant states or exotic lands may play constantly in your ears.

2016|9|14|11|If you've never tried your hand at the arts, Aquarius, this is the day to do it. Your imagination and ingenuity are flying high, and your aesthetic sense is acute right now.

2016|9|15|1|"You may get the feeling that you're operating in an emotional crossfire today, Aries. On the one hand, you may have a ""me first,"" selfish feeling that demands attention from others. You may also sense the need to work to serve others and bring like-minded people together. Realize that both of these energies are valid and deserve your attention. Balance is the key. Work to soothe your fluctuating emotions.
                
             "|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|15|2|You'll enjoy a day of high spirits and friendly interactions. The energy of the day is in your favor, although it may not seem like it. Your emotions may become cloudy and it might seem like people are working against you. Although this may be true to some extent, realize that much of this paranoia comes more from your emotional insecurity than another's plot against you.|Pisces|Virgo|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|15|3|Ask for help if you need it, Gemini. Your nature is to serve others, but in order to maintain that energy, make sure that you're taken care of as well. Offer extra hugs to the people you love. In work-related issues, make sure that you aren't biting off more than you can chew. Delegate tasks to others. Pamper yourself tonight with a hot bath and a good meal.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|15|4|Keeping your emotions in balance is going to be the key to a successful day, Cancer. Don't get swept away by a fanciful situation that could send your mind spinning.

It will be hard enough to keep your mind clear without them.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|15|5|You may feel like you're running into a brick wall at every turn, Leo, especially when it comes to emotions.

2016|9|15|7|Make sure you're getting enough sleep, Libra. You may seem groggy and your head could be a bit cloudy today, but try not to let this stop you from getting your work done.

Try to keep both feet on the ground.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|15|8|There may be an area of your life that seems completely fanciful now, Scorpio. The issues regarding it have become a bit hazy. You may no longer be sure of the reality of the situation.

Try to stay balanced and gain a new perspective on the situation.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|15|9|Your fantasy life is especially active today, Sagittarius, so enjoy this little break into your dream world. Coming back to reality may be difficult.

Have confidence in yourself and take the lead.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|15|11|You may have a strange paranoia that people are out to get you today, Aquarius, but don't let this feeling paralyze you. Your emotions are more than likely getting the better of you. The reality of the situation is much different than your sensitive emotions perceive. Avoid the tendency to escape even further into this fantasy world. Stay away from drugs or alcohol.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars

Your efforts should attract the attention of those who matter and eventually lead to advancement or a raise. Don't be afraid to continue to explore these sources. Keep up the good work!|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|21|12|A passionate encounter with a love partner might cement the bond between you so thoroughly that you start talking about commitment or even a wedding. A romantic haze may permeate your interactions. Still, exercise some restraint in expressing your feelings. Hitting your friend with too much at once could have the opposite effect from the one you're hoping for. Be patient!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|22|1|You may feel a bit restless and unsettled without really knowing why, Aries. Stresses on the job could churn up repressed resentment from the past that you need to release. Try to discern exactly what these stresses remind you of. If you're unable to do this, however, you'll probably still reap the benefits of the release. Stay focused on your work and just let it happen.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|22|2|Too many people could be vying for your attention today, Taurus. All of them want advice or help. This could be flattering, and you'll probably want to help them, but it can also be unsettling and make it hard to focus. Don't let this set your temper on edge and cause you to snap at your friends. Take each request one at a time, make no promises, and do your best.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|22|3|There could be trouble brewing in the workplace, Gemini. Some of your colleagues neither like nor trust each other and find it impossible to work together. Adjustments are needed if everyone is going to work to the best of their abilities. If you're in a position to handle this, do it now. If you aren't, distance yourself from the situation. It's the only way to stay sane!|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|22|4|Squabbles may come up between you and a sibling or neighbor, Cancer. Your ability to compromise is definitely called for here. If you aren't careful, this could turn into a battle of wills. The minute the disagreement comes up, try to talk it out and turn it into a win/win situation. Otherwise, things may be said that shouldn't be, and feelings could remain hurt for a long time.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|22|5|Money matters might cause you a few headaches, Leo. You could be torn between the desire to put money aside for the future and the impulse to buy something that you've wanted for a long time. There may be a way to have it both ways. Save a little less and try to find a bargain price for your item. Take everything into consideration and work it out before you make yourself crazy.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|22|6|Too much rigorous exercise over the past few days might have you feeling a little sore and tired, Virgo. Your nerves may be on edge, and you could be more likely than usual to snap at those around you. Try to ease both nerves and muscle aches by soaking in a hot bath. Herbal tea might also help. Accept that you should take it easy today and then do it!|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|22|7|Spiritual breakthroughs may have you feeling a little disconcerted, Libra. Clearing away deadwood, such as past traumas, might tell you a few things about yourself you'd rather not face. It's vital to release them in order to progress as a human being. Even if tears are involved, this is a positive development. You'll feel happier once it's all set free. Onward and upward!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|22|8|A conference of some kind could touch upon some pretty volatile issues, Scorpio. People could disagree to the point that the meeting turns into a shouting match. You probably have strong opinions on this as well, but don't get involved. You won't be able to stop the argument, and it can only cause you stress. If you can, avoid this meeting altogether. Think about it!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|22|9|Is your significant other caught up in family problems and unable to spend time with you? Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Your partner needs to deal with family now. Relax, do what you want to do, and have confidence that you'll be spending more time together as soon as possible. After dealing with family quarrels, you'll be a peaceful refuge for your partner.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|22|10|Matters involving communication seem to be fouled up, Capricorn. Messages may not get delivered, emails may not go through, and people might misinterpret your words. This could create a mess that brings everything to a screeching halt. You need to speak to people directly, give detailed instructions, use simple language, and make sure they take notes, or beware of the consequences!|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|22|11|Your values could oppose those of a business or romantic partner today, Aquarius. One of you may be overly pragmatic and the other too idealistic. One seems callous, while the other seems to be living in a dream world. This could be a milestone in your relationship if approached properly. If you can't create a win/win situation, perhaps you should reconsider the partnership.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|22|12|If you've been having trouble reaching a romantic partner, Pisces, it might be a good idea to stop trying. Your friend is having a rough day and might not make the best company. In fact, your beloved could view a call from you as an unwelcome interruption and be short, if not downright rude. If you speak with your friend, keep it brief and plan to get together - just not today.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|23|1|This is a good time to forge new relationships, Aries. Be open-minded if someone you know approaches with a proposal. Do your homework and examine the potential risks, but this is a fine period in which to pursue something new. Success and good fortune are coming. Keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities. You may hear some important news from your love interest.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|23|2|You're feeling your power and strength today, Taurus. You've worked hard to get into good physical shape.

2016|9|23|5|Did you forget to take two aspirin before you fell into bed last night? This morning you may feel in a fog, but it should lift around midday.

Enjoy the boost of energy that this good news gives you.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|23|6|If it's true that you reap what you sow, Virgo, you're in for a great harvest in the coming months. Your hard work and focus will start to pay off handsomely with promotions and raises just when you may have given up on being acknowledged for all you do. Hang on to your great energy, passion, and enthusiasm. Doors are about to open for you. Get ready to walk through them.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|23|7|You're highly esteemed in your profession because of your strong business acumen and no-nonsense approach to problem solving.

Don't let your caution bog you down at the moment. It could be surprisingly wonderful.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|23|9|Expect to receive interesting communications today, Sagittarius. You might hear from a long-lost friend and have a chance to catch up on the news.

2016|9|23|11|With the current celestial energy, you might be going on a trip, Aquarius. It may be for business, pleasure, or both. It's likely that this trip will achieve certain goals. Perhaps you're aiming for a promotion. Chances are you'll be successful in your ambitions. Or, you may be ready to set out on your own and start a new business. It's an excellent time for this, too.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|23|12|Don't be surprised if money comes from an unlikely source. It could be a surprisingly good return on an investment or a bequest from a relative.

All in all, this is a great time.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|1|"Today you could run into an old friend and suddenly see him or her in a different light. A romantic, sensual attraction you never believed possible could suddenly seem overwhelming. Try to gauge if this person feels the same way. If so, plan a date. Don't write this possibility off because you've labeled this person a ""friend."""|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|2|A current or potential love relationship could hit a snag as you have a clash of wills. If either of you is stubborn, this could turn into an unpleasant power struggle. Try to work out a course of action that creates a win/win situation, so neither of you feels compromised. In this way, the development of your relationship will progress rather than regress.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|24|3|An opportunity to increase your income by working in an artistic or innovative manner could come your way today, Gemini. Technologies like film or computer graphics may be involved. You may have doubts about your ability to take this on, but that's only your insecurity. Don't be timid. Have a little confidence in yourself. Consider it all carefully. If it seems workable, go for it!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|4|Circumstances beyond your control may frustrate your desire to get together with a love partner today, Cancer. Work or family obligations could interfere. If your partner has to beg off, don't get upset and start doling out blame. This won't help and could put your friend on the defensive. Make arrangements to meet another day. Absence makes the heart grow fonder!|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|24|5|Visitors who mean a lot to you can make your home an even warmer and cozier place, Leo. You'll probably spend a lot of time fixing it up and receive sincere compliments. The only downside might be that your current partner may not be there due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. Enjoy the visit, and invite your friends to return when your partner is there.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|24|6|A long but necessary phone call from a close friend or love partner could come at work today, Virgo. Matters of immediate concern need resolution. You might be uneasy about taking company time, and could even attract some unsettling attention, but you need to have this conversation now. It probably won't have any long-term negative effects, so do what you have to do. You'll feel a lot better.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|24|7|Today you might discover a previously untapped talent, Libra, perhaps an artistic gift. This could be thrilling, but it will probably take some getting used to.

Eventually you'll probably love what you do.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|8|You should be looking especially attractive, Scorpio. You may have an ethereal, mystical look about you that attracts attention from strangers. This won't be lost on your friends, either. You could find it unsettling, particularly if people get too attentive or if a love partner gets jealous. Relax and enjoy it anyway. Needless to say, this is a great day to shop for clothes!|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|9|Your phone may seem haunted today, Sagittarius. Calls might be filled with static, you could get some phantom rings, or callers may insist they tried to call when your phone never rang.

There could be problems with your equipment.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|24|10|A reassessment of your financial goals may be needed now, Capricorn. Some of your expectations may be unrealistic, and you might need to look at them in a more practical light. This doesn't mean they won't happen, just that they're apt to take a little longer than you'd like. Think of it as an opportunity to develop patience. Rework your budget and hang in there!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|24|11|Are you romantically attracted to someone you know through work, Aquarius? If so, this isn't a good time to pursue it. You might be wearing your heart on your sleeve a little too obviously. This could be unsettling for your friend, and it might sabotage the results you're hoping for. Be patient and let the relationship develop. Your feelings could well be mutual!|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|24|12|Inspiration for writing, music, drawing, painting, or other creative activities could hover just out of reach today, Pisces. Great ideas could pop into your head and out just as quickly. The only way to avoid the frustration of missing out on wonderful ideas is to write them down as soon as they come. Making notes can also stimulate further inspiration. Go for it!|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|1|If you're currently romantically involved, Aries, your lover could well go from what appears to be utter lassitude to total passion. This could throw you for a loop, and you might not know exactly how to deal with it. If you're single, you could meet someone you find attractive but forget to get his or her contact information! Keep paper and pen handy. You don't want to miss anything!|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|25|2|Have you made plans to have a romantic interest come to your home, Taurus? If so, don't rush to get ready. Your friend is probably going to be late. Events beyond anyone's control have interfered, and you might have to wait. Don't make yourself crazy over it. Don't imagine all kinds of horrible scenarios. Your friend will show up even if later than planned. Have fun!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|3|A visitor to your house may have some juicy gossip for you, Gemini. Perhaps someone is getting married. You aren't the type to put too much stock in gossip, but your guest could be so convincing that you believe everything. Be skeptical! What you're hearing may not be outright lies, but it could be exaggerated. Wait until you see the people in question before accepting it as truth.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|25|4|A last-minute gift that you've wanted to buy for someone special might elude you today, Cancer. You could go to several stores and find the item sold out.

Relax and enjoy your shopping.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|25|5|Everything may look wrong to you today, Leo. The house doesn't look right, the furniture needs adjusting, and you probably aren't happy with the way you look either. Your perfectionism could kick in and you might plunge into action, determined to make it all right. Don't bother! There's probably nothing you can do to make it look right today. Relax. You'll see things differently tomorrow.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|25|6|A gathering in your neighborhood could attract all your friends and many of your neighbors, Virgo, but you may feel a little under the weather and consider staying home. Your energy may be lagging, as all energy does once in a while after a stressful time. It might do you good to make the effort and go. It's up to you, of course, but enjoy the evening whatever you do.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|7|A quick check of your bank balance might reveal that it's a bit lower than you expected, Libra. You probably won't panic, but you're apt to feel a little disappointed. Don't waste time kicking yourself. Money can always be earned. Relax, resolve to tighten your belt a little, take care of the necessities, and stick with a financial plan. Soon you'll be glad you took action.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|8|Working late, Scorpio? What could be so important that it keeps you from paying attention to your family or partner? Probably nothing! Take a good, objective look at what you think must be done tonight. You'll probably find that your company won't go broke if you leave some tasks. Get as much done as you can and then go home to your loved ones. They're important, too!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|25|9|A prayer or meditation group could meet tonight, Sagittarius, and you may get carried away with the spiritual dimensions these meditations take on. You feel comfortable with the people in this group, and you're grateful for the friendship and support they provide. Be with this feeling tonight, and try to hang onto it for as long as you can. It can help you through some rough times.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|25|10|Love matters have been going well for you recently, Capricorn, but today you could be alone and unable to reach a current or potential romantic interest. This could bring about a twinge of the blues, which up until now have passed you by. Don't waste time feeling down. Find something to distract you until your friend can come around to see you and you can have a little fun.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|11|You could go over your accounts today and find that there's considerably less there than you thought. It isn't serious, but it can still be disappointing. There could be a new contract in the final stages of negotiation that will prove favorable, and you can find a way to make up for the shortfall. In the meantime, cut expenses so finances stay healthy until the new contract materializes.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|25|12|Have you been going crazy with all the demands placed on you? Don't despair. Reflect on all that's been going on. Think about where you want to make changes. Once you've come to a decision, don't hesitate to implement it. This is easier than waiting for one big opportunity and doing it all at once. That chance may never come. The step-by-step approach can bring satisfying results.|Scorpio|Taurus|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|1|Your intuition is working overtime today, Aries, making you sensitive to others' deepest emotions. It may be that the celestial atmosphere has everyone feeling open and honest, eager to grow into his or her most authentic self. Certainly that's how you feel. Take some time out of your busy schedule to reflect on your regrets and successes. Be as true to yourself as possible.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|26|2|No pressure, Taurus, but as things are now, you might want to evaluate your career. Is it working out well? What are your latest achievements? What goals haven't been reached? If the answers aren't satisfactory, it's time to make some dramatic changes. If your work doesn't make your heart sing, it's time to find some that does. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. Get going!|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|3|The time is right for all things financial, Gemini. If you've been thinking of signing a contract to accept a job or purchase a piece of property, go ahead. Strategize ways in which you can be even more financially successful in the future. You have a lot of skills, but you don't always apply them as carefully as you could. Correct this and you'll be unstoppable!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|4|Expect to get some useful financial information today, Cancer. You may learn about a new investment, or perhaps you'll get wind of a job opening that's right up your alley.

Although there's nothing wrong with the one you're on, it's always good to consider other roads.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|5|Expect your romantic relationship to be better than ever today, Leo. You're communicating well and in touch with one another's feelings.

Your partner won't mind discussing this.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|26|6|This could be a banner day, Virgo. Your spiritual and career goals come together so both are enhanced and neither is compromised. It's a neat trick. You can expect the opportunity to practice what you preach to come to you through a friend or colleague. Don't discount any ideas presented to you, as one will contain the key to meshing two of the most important parts of your life.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|26|7|Be your most charming self tonight, Libra. You're likely to meet someone who can help your career. Your intuition is strong, so you may know who this person is the minute you shake hands.

Whether this person impacts your life in a romantic or business capacity, you'll remember this night as when your life changed for the better!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|26|8|You have an introspective nature, Scorpio. For the last few weeks you've been reflecting on and assessing what does and doesn't work in your life. It's likely that you're ready for some kind of major change. Either your relationship is in a rut or you need a complete career overhaul. Follow your instincts as you plan how to develop and grow from here. You are your own best guide.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|9|You're ready for something new and different, Sagittarius. What better time than during the current transits to put into practice what has only been a dream?

If not, you may have to wait a long time to feel this energetic and optimistic again.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|26|10|You'll do some serious soul searching today. Which goals have you achieved and which ones have gone unattained? Be honest as you reflect on past months. Could you have done things differently? Would you like to do things differently in the future? You'd be well advised to write down your successes and regrets. Use the list to keep you on track. It's bound to be a great help to you.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|26|11|Today you'll realize that a clean slate brings with it the chance for a new beginning. You feel excited and optimistic about the future. Your goals are clear and your mind is sharp.

Keep your eyes on your attainable goals rather than waste time and energy chasing pipe dreams.|Libra|Aries|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|26|12|You may be ready for some major career changes, Pisces. You could be fed up with the stress and long hours of the corporate environment.

If you propose a feasible alternative to your boss, the positive response may surprise you.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|1|Too much hard work and stress could be taking a physical toll on you today, Aries. But it isn't likely to stop you from working intently and energetically on a project that fascinates you.

Go to it!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|2|If you're single, Taurus, today you could fall in love at first sight. A friend could introduce you to someone new and exciting who shares your interests and with whom you'll talk for hours. This could make you feel happy. You'll certainly enjoy your day. If you want to stay in touch, don't be afraid to exchange contact information. Otherwise, you might lose track of your new friend.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|3|Have you been considering working at home, Gemini? If so, today you might decide to do just that. An opportunity could pave the way for new jobs you could do at home, in your own space, among your own belongings. This could add to your sense of security. The only downside could be if you don't make the effort, you might never leave the house. Join a health club!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|4|A visit to a sibling or neighbor could see you make a new friend today, Cancer, probably someone who works in a creative profession. If you're currently romantically involved, this person could become your best friend. If you're unattached, sparks could fly between you and him or her. You could talk for hours and part unwillingly. Exchange contact information. You'll be glad you did!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|27|5|Changes taking place at home could lead to more income, Leo. Perhaps a new housemate moves in, reducing your housing costs. Or you might even consider moving to a new place, perhaps one that's closer to where family members live or work. Whatever it is, it may not seem like much, but it should make a difference in your financial situation in the long run. Go for it!|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|27|6|A walk through your neighborhood, perhaps with friends, could put you in the middle of an unexpected, interesting event, Virgo. It may be a public gathering, like a fair, or an impromptu get-together, like a rally. Whatever it is, you and your friends could be transfixed by it. Make mental notes and then write down your impressions later.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|27|7|Some books you've been reading lately might excite your desire to study astrology, numerology, alchemy, or some other occult science, Libra. This may not be something that you'd normally consider, but don't let that hold you back. Your values have been shaken up lately anyway, so make the most of the impulse now. It could transform you in a subtle way. Go for it!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|8|Boredom might stimulate your rebellious streak today, Scorpio. You could decide to forego your usual tasks and do something unusual or unexpected, such as skydiving or horseback riding. Don't feel guilty if you decide to do this. We all need to throw caution to the wind and go for some excitement occasionally. Follow your instincts and have fun!|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|27|9|A class or lecture of some kind could bring you exciting new information today, Sagittarius. This could keep your mind buzzing for hours, particularly since you may also meet some interesting people with whom you can discuss this subject for hours. Make the effort to take a walk and clear your head at some point during the day or else you might be too mentally charged up to sleep.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|27|10|A journey may be in the works right now, Capricorn. Many changes have been occurring in your life for a long time, and they continue today. They might involve group events or educational activities. This may be something you've anticipated for a long time. Your energy, enthusiasm, and excitement are high. You may be too restless to sit still. Try to get some exercise at some point.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|11|A change in career could be in the works for you, Aquarius. It might be within the scope of your current job or an entirely new one. It's definitely a change for the better. Don't let insecurity or an attachment to your current circumstances hold you back. Whatever opportunities appear at this time may not come around again for a long while. Think about it carefully and then follow your heart.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|27|12|An unexpected opportunity to go on a long journey, perhaps business-related, could come to you soon, Pisces. A partner might be involved. Your enthusiasm may be almost boundless, but remember that your physical energy isn't. If you choose to travel right now, make sure you coddle yourself a little to avoid exhaustion. Otherwise, have fun!|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|1|This could be a quiet day for you and your partner, Aries. You could spend some time reflecting on past achievements and future goals. It's important to get a clear picture about the past so you can draw conclusions and make workable plans. If you have a family, you'll probably be interested in activities that everyone will enjoy. Make some time to get together. Leave tension behind.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|2|All the positive energy generated by the celestial atmosphere seems to come together today as you experience a rush of sensual passion for a romantic partner, Taurus. An unexpected encounter could not only fulfill this desire but also bring you closer. If you aren't already committed, expect to discuss it tonight. Be careful to exercise restraint. Your lover could panic if you push too hard.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|3|The arrival of a surprise visitor could generate mixed feelings, Gemini. On the one hand, you're probably glad to resume contact with this person. On the other, because you weren't expecting any guests, it could create extra work for you - as if you didn't already have enough on your plate! Recruit others to help with necessary tasks so you can enjoy your evening.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|28|4|Someone who's been ill and perhaps undergone surgery might phone you today, Cancer. You could invite this person to join you for a little social gathering. Several people could be involved. All of them will have some interesting and useful information to offer. Natives of Cancer in particular might attract your attention. Enjoy your day.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|28|5|With the planetary atmosphere today, your sensual nature is in full bloom. If there's a romantic partner nearby, that person should be on guard! There may be a lot of other people around, so a chance to be alone probably won't present itself until this evening. If you don't connect with a potential partner, at least you'll have a good time. Hang in there and be patient!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|28|6|You might have to play nurse today, Virgo. A love partner could claim to feel unwell, and you might expend a lot of energy trying to make your friend feel better. Don't overdo it. There may be psychological factors at work. Your friend could be jealous of the attention you've been giving family and friends. Be attentive, but within limits!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|7|You're generally focused on the material world, Libra, but something about the energy generated by today's planetary alignments causes you to look within. You might think about the joys and pains of past family gatherings and wonder how they affect your life now. This is a positive, healing process, so don't fight it. It won't interfere with what's going on around you.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|28|8|A group event could put you in contact with a number of people interested in doing a healing meditation for the planet. This sort of activity can work wonders to strengthen the bond among those performing it. You might not talk much during the discussions, but you're apt to be in total agreement with the idea. Enjoy your day.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|28|9|Happiness reigns in the home as everyone feels the energy changing, Sagittarius. It seems that the end of one cycle brings closure, and now you're free to start a new journey of rebirth. You, above all, are apt to feel a powerful rush of intuition, which could reveal positive events coming up for you and those close to you. A few doubts may cloud your impressions, but let them go.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|10|Are you going to go away soon, Capricorn? If not, you may be planning a trip for another month, perhaps going for educational purposes, such as to attend a workshop. You might have agreed to some overseas business travel. You should feel especially energetic, enthusiastic, and optimistic now. You've done well thanks to your diligent work, and you should continue on that path.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|11|Instinct and determination drive you toward unconventional plans for making money, Aquarius. A finance counselor or other professional could be involved. You may see this as an opportunity to restore your ailing bank account. You may have future purchases in mind, perhaps even a new home. Consider your plans carefully before going ahead. You'll want to be sure it's what you need.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|28|12|Today you may feel a passionate attraction for someone intelligent who perhaps makes a living in law, education, or publishing, Pisces. Conversations with this person could touch on some deep issues, such as spiritual matters, the human psyche, or the nature of the universe. You should be deeply affected, not only by the person but also by the subjects. Take a walk later to clear your head.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|1|You and other members of your household might suddenly decide to do one more thorough house cleaning, Aries. Usually this would be a good idea, but today it doesn't really need it, and you might work too hard and do too much. Do you really need to clean your closets now? Dust and vacuum, then spruce it up with some decorations, and that should be enough for now. Relax!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|29|2|Too many people may be making demands on your time right now, Taurus. Some may have genuine concerns and need your assistance, but others have definite agendas that they really should deal with on their own. Use your intuition to tell the difference, because you won't be able to help them all. A female friend might have the most urgent need. If you can only help one, help her.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|3|A lot of creative work may need to be finished by today, Gemini. If you're professionally involved with writing, a deadline may loom. It could be difficult to get it done because family members and guests could constantly go in and out and keep you from concentrating. The best course of action might be to go somewhere quiet, like a library, and do your work there. Think about it!|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|4|What's happening in your community today that attracts crowds, Cancer? A parade? A festival of some kind? Some friends may want you to go with them. You might think you're too busy, but an hour or two away from your chores certainly won't hurt. Take some time out. This is a time for having fun! Go if you want to. You could meet some interesting people.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|29|5|You may be too free with your money right now, Leo. You're usually careful with it, but the spirit of generosity and abundance is definitely upon you. You're more inclined to be generous with those you care about. After all is said and done, you could panic, but don't. You're good at making money. A little belt tightening later is entirely possible, and it won't hurt you. Follow your heart - within limitations.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|29|6|You usually love to talk, Virgo, but right now you've probably reached your limit. You've attended a number of gatherings and talked to a lot of people over the past week or so, and now you want to sit quietly at home. If friends or family members insist on your going out with them, don't be afraid to say no. Everyone knows how busy you've been. Take some time to yourself and relax.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|7|Have you been indulging in too many goodies, Libra? You might feel under the weather because of all this abundance. You probably should take it easy. Think about reorganizing your priorities. Is a second piece of chocolate cake more important than your energy and health? Indulging can be important to your psyche, but don't forget about moderation - and don't forget that there are many other ways to indulge.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|8|It has been said that you can never have too many friends, Scorpio, but today you might wonder if perhaps you do. Your phone could be ringing off the hook. One person after another will be soliciting you for advice and your famous shoulder to cry on. Be patient. One day you may need that person to be there for you. Try to listen and keep your sense of humor about you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|29|9|A public gathering of some kind could attract you and your family tonight, Sagittarius. Perhaps you will arrange to meet some friends there. You may feel good just being out with those you love, but you're likely to be tired by the end of the event. Make sure you fortify yourself with nourishing food during the day. Take care of yourself so you can have some fun.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|29|10|Too many phone calls and visits may be on the agenda today, Capricorn. You might also have a few last-minute errands to run in your neighborhood. It won't be easy, probably because of crowds and traffic. Nonetheless, your sense of excitement and enthusiasm will help you tolerate conditions that would normally be very frustrating. Furthermore, you're having fun! Go to it.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|29|11|You may have lost your usual control of the purse strings and spent too much money lately, Aquarius. Don't worry about it. It's all been for a good cause. It's nothing you can't handle, and certainly not enough to bankrupt you. The situation is only temporary anyway. The financial picture looks great for you in the months to come. Make the most of it!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|29|12|Generally you're a very sociable person, Pisces, and today you aren't likely to slow down. Invitations to parties, from intimate coffee klatches to big neighborhood bashes, continue to come in. There may be too many to handle, so you might have to turn some of them down. That goes against your nature! You don't want to miss anything. Pick the most important to you and leave the rest.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|30|1|It's possible that a big change is in store for you in the near future, Aries. It may be that you've come to realize that your current home and neighborhood are no longer a good fit. If you've been toying with the idea of moving, today you may get some news that motivates you to make your fantasy a reality. This is a good day to peruse the real estate listings. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|30|2|Perhaps you spent quite a bit of money lately and you're holding your breath waiting for the bills to roll in. Some quick reckoning of receipts today likely yields some wonderful news. Wonder of wonders, it appears you've stayed within your budget, Taurus! Try not to overreact to the news that you have more money than you thought. Give your wallet and checkbook some time off.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|30|3|This is a good day to reflect on the past weeks and get some perspective, Gemini. You've probably been working too hard and neglecting other priorities in your life. Give yourself this day to relax and visit with friends and relatives. Spend the day chatting, laughing, and unwinding. Don't obsess about tasks that wait for you at the office. They aren't going anywhere.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|30|4|Don't plunge headfirst into work mode, Cancer. The cleaning and tidying up can surely wait for another day. Today's energies indicate that spending time with friends and family should be your main priority. Consider spending the afternoon doing activities with your kids. Hire a babysitter for the evening. It would do you good to go out with your partner - just the two of you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|9|30|5|It's likely that your thoughts are completely turned to work. Much as you should devote your time off to friends and family, you can't help the way you're wired, Leo. When at home, you may sneak away to check your email. Perhaps you secretly phone your business partner. Your family rolls their eyes, but generally understands and forgives your crazy behavior. Be sure to turn on the extra charm, just in case!|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|9|30|6|This is a good day for financial matters, Virgo. With your credit cards maxed out, you may be thinking that your bank account isn't as healthy as it could be. But today you're likely to receive some news that indicates otherwise. You may get a windfall or discover that your portfolio is generating healthy returns. It's a good day for paperwork.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|9|30|7|You could be feeling quite lazy today, Libra, and you definitely deserve to feel this way! You deserve some time off after all of the activities of the past week. Give yourself the gift of a true day off. Do only what you want, whether it's watching movies or spending the afternoon soaking in the tub. Total indulgence. Just relax and unwind.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|30|8|You think of yourself as a practical person, Scorpio, but today your thoughts may turn to the mystical and spiritual. Your intuition is strong now, letting you tune in to the feelings of your loved ones. This allows you to be empathetic and understanding, which your partner especially appreciates. Your intuition may inspire you to approach a problem in a new way. Let your mind wander and see what develops.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|9|30|9|You will probably encounter a bit of opposition along with today's planetary energies, Sagittarius. Even those who are usually right behind you will seem uncooperative. Try not to let this faze you too much. Resolve to follow your own instincts and work alone if need be. Once you've had a chance to advance your ideas further along on your own, you can present them again.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|9|30|10|Your thoughts today are likely to turn to setting goals for the future, particularly concerning your career. While you've made a lot of progress in recent months, you'd like to see even more forward movement. This would be a great day to start thinking of concrete ways to make that happen, Capricorn. Why not have a family brainstorming session? It's likely to yield some great advice.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|9|30|11|Today's planetary energies are stimulating your ambition, Aquarius. Issues connected with your professional life may be very much on your mind. You could plot out ways to further your career. Perhaps you seek a promotion in your current business, or you could be thinking about looking for another job entirely. This is the ideal time to put specific plans into place for the future.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|9|30|12|You've been so busy socializing these past few weeks that you may have inadvertently neglected the special person in your life, Pisces. It's been fun to be out and about together, attending parties and having people over for dinner, but that has left little time for closeness and snuggling. Try to rectify that today. In fact, a midafternoon nap might be called for. Why not invite your honey to join you?|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|1|Life's been a real social whirl lately, Aries. You may feel a bit overwhelmed by all the people and parties. It's fun to see everyone, but a bit daunting to renew ties with old friends and try to remember the names of new ones. Names and faces mingle to the point where you aren't sure of your own name, much less anyone else's. Take a deep breath, Aries, you're doing just fine.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|2|With all the social events you've attended lately, Taurus, it's likely that you've met some people in the healing professions. These doctors, nurses, and technicians could be useful to you later. Be sure to file their contact information away for future reference. On another front, expect to receive some good news concerning your finances.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|1|3|You may discover an untapped talent today, Gemini. Perhaps there's a new machine in the office and you're the only one who can figure out how to use it. Maybe drafting a simple business proposal makes you realize how much you enjoy the writing process. This is a good day for any kind of creative endeavor, as well as for paperwork of all sorts. Get everything done so you can enjoy the evening.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|1|4|Expect some positive developments today that impact the whole family, Cancer. Perhaps you or your mate will receive word of a significant raise or great job opportunity. Perhaps you meet the one who is right for you, and you know it the instant you shake hands. Whichever it is, don't let the opportunity pass. If you don't seize it, someone else surely will.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|5|You should be feeling especially confident today, Leo. You've been working especially hard lately, and the recognition you've received goes a long way toward reinforcing your feelings of self-worth. Your life goals suddenly seem more attainable and you'll pursue them with renewed vigor. Your confidence is grounded in reality. You will surely succeed.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|6|This is a day made for fun and frivolity, Virgo, not one in which you're likely to get many of your chores done. Try as you might to focus on the task at hand, there are distractions everywhere you turn. Your email pals could be sending you jokes and notes, and your friends could be bugging you to join them for an outing of some sort. You may as well give in.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|1|7|You're a person of many talents, and today you're likely to discover yet another one, Libra. The delivery of a new piece of equipment makes you feel like you've been given a toy for your sole enjoyment. But once you get the computer or piece of machinery up and running, you need to share it with your co-workers! They will be very impressed with your technical abilities.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|1|8|Don't be surprised if people surround you today, each one anxious to confer with you. It seems that you're the authority on all topics, Scorpio. All the attention is flattering, but it makes it difficult to get any work done. Do what you can to help your co-workers, and then tell them that the help desk is closed for the day. You want to leave work early so you can be with your loved ones.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|1|9|Don't let yourself be manipulated by needy friends, Sagittarius. With today's planetary energies, it's a good time to think about setting clear boundaries. You know which friends are there for you and lift you up and which ones tend to drain all your time and energy with the constant need for your immediate attention. Try saying no. You can't fix other people's lives for them anyway. Think about it.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|10|This is a good day for sharing friendship with pals and co-workers, Capricorn. People will be in a light, socializing mood and not much in a working frame of mind. There's really no use fighting this energy. Enjoy yourself today and allow yourself to detach from work issues. You can all get back to the grindstone later. The work will still be there.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|1|11|Your technical skills take a real leap forward today, Aquarius. It seems all that training you've done is finally paying off. Your new skills will greatly increase your efficiency and enhance your marketability. If you've been thinking about applying for a new position, get your resume ready to send out when you see an appealing ad. Any move you make will be for the better.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|1|12|Don't be surprised to see your co-workers acting a bit silly today, Pisces. There is no getting around the high spirits that permeate the office environment. It's almost impossible to get any work done with today's planetary atmosphere. Rather than cracking the whip and trying to increase productivity, why not join in? Lighten up a little.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|1|If you own your home or have any kind of investments in real estate, Aries, you might hear some great news today about the value of that investment. It's likely to be increasing, and probably will continue in that direction. This could make a big difference in your life in some way right now. In fact, there might be a number of options opening to you. Consider them all carefully, and go for the gold.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|2|2|Are you technically single but very deeply involved with someone, Taurus? If so, don't be surprised if today you extend or receive a proposal of marriage. Recent events have brought you very close together and greatly intensified the bond between you. Your partner may want to legalize that bond. Do you? If there is even the smallest doubt, give yourself some time to think. Acting on impulse isn't a good idea right now.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|2|3|Exciting news could come to you today that could bring a lot of joy into your life, Gemini. Your income may soon skyrocket, and more opportunities to advance yourself professionally should start coming thick and fast. You may even receive some sort of public acknowledgment. This isn't the end of the line, however - this is only the beginning! You will be glad to know you can expect this trend to continue for some time.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|4|A powerful bond between you and a romantic partner could have you walking around with your head in the clouds, Cancer. Things between you seem to be improving by leaps and bounds. Right now it all seems just too perfect. Savor every moment of your time together. You will want to remember them when times aren't quite so easy. We all deserve such halcyon days. You and your beloved should definitely make the most of it.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|5|Leo, love of all kinds - the love of friends, the affection of family members, romantic love - flourishes in the home today as a number of visitors come to your door, perhaps unexpectedly. One of your guests could bring some wonderful news about money. A strong sense of unity among all those present should be very apparent, at least to you.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|2|6|A large gathering of friends, relatives, and neighbors could take place in your neighborhood today, Virgo. You might run into a few old friends you haven't seen in a long time and enjoy catching up. A former romantic partner could also be present. Are you still interested? If so, pursue it. It might work this time! If you're no longer interested, perhaps you could now be friends. Think about it!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|2|7|If you've asked your employer for a raise recently, Libra, the astral energy indicates that you can expect to receive one soon. Your employer is greatly impressed with your efforts, and probably thinking that you might be setting your sights elsewhere. Opportunities may certainly appear, although this is obviously not the time to make a decision. Take some time to really think and consider everything carefully.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|2|8|An unexpected letter or package might arrive sometime today, Scorpio. This could be a gift from a lover - perhaps a bit more lavish than you would have expected. You could receive other communications as well. At least one could be related to your job in some way. A party invitation could also come, and you will probably want to attend. A significant other will want to accompany you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|9|Happiness reigns in the home right now, Sagittarius. Money comes pouring in from bonuses, salary from extra hours, or gifts. You may be considering spending some of this money on either adding to or refurbishing your home. If you're having trouble making a decision, consider consulting a decorator. There is great harmony within your family. You seem to understand each other on an intuitive level.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|2|10|Are you single, Capricorn? If so, today you might fall in love at first sight. You may have been frustrated lately by the lack of available, interesting people, but today you could meet someone who seems too perfect for words. And you can rest assured that the attraction is mutual! If you're already involved, you can expect a revival of the fairytale romance between you and a significant other.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|11|A strong attraction to someone could take you by surprise today, Aquarius. This person could be involved in the arts in some way, perhaps film, television, or recording. You might spend considerable time together for the purpose of working on a project, but the energy between you should be strong and apparent to both of you. If you're interested in a new relationship, make sure you look your best!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|2|12|Are you involved in a creative project that involves modern technology, Pisces? If so, progress could be made by leaps and bounds, starting today. A lucky break might set you off in a new direction that adds depth and dimension to your work. Relations with colleagues should be warm, congenial, and supportive. There is a sense of unity that pervades the group and adds to the energy and enthusiasm. You will love the results of your efforts.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|1|It could be that you feel a bit of pressure today to start or create something that you aren't quite ready for, Aries. There is hesitation on your part that indicates you should take it slowly and learn more of the facts before you jump into the fray. Position yourself in such a way that you take control of the situation rather than become a victim of it.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|2|Move forward with your plan of attack today, Taurus. There's an anxious rumble within you that's urging you to get going with a current plan. You have all the facts you need, so don't hesitate any longer. The power of the word is with you. You will be smooth, collected, and confident even in the most nerve-wracking situations. Words will flow off your tongue with ease.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|3|3|Add spark to your life today, Gemini. It could be that things are getting stale and boring. If so, consider the possibility that you simply aren't challenging yourself enough. Remember that you're responsible for lighting your own fire. You have the perfect opportunity to get something started today, so go for it. Feel free to get other people to help.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|3|4|People are apt to try to hit you square on the head with their ideas and thoughts today, Cancer, so be ready for the onslaught of information that may come your way. There's a distinct advantage to listening to the whole spiel before you react with your own facts and emotions. The problem is that you're going to be tempted to argue instead of calmly resolve the matter.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|5|Anchor yourself in practical matters before you try to prove your point to others. There's a great deal of primal energy rising within you today and searching for some sort of outlet. Be aware of overextending yourself when it comes to issues of the mind. You may be so anxious to prove your point that you end up losing sight of the reality of the situation.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|6|"Don't take no for an answer today, Virgo. Know what you believe in and stick with it. There's a distinct advantage to holding true to your inner nature. Don't let others throw you off course with their views on how things should be done. Be confident and don't worry about taking things over the top. There's no such thing as excess today. ""The more the merrier"" should be your motto."|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|7|Be a pioneer thinker today, Libra. There's a noble courage in your thoughts, so don't let this quality go to waste. You will be surprised at how cutting edge you can be when you put your mind to it. Take a walk by yourself and contemplate the next major move that you'd like to make in your life. Feel free to brainstorm bold ways to execute this plan.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|3|8|Be aggressive and forceful when it comes to exerting your will, Scorpio. Let others know that you won't be a pushover. Your opinions are extremely important, and they need to be heard by the people who matter the most. Have faith that whatever you say has the power to come true, especially when you enlist the help of those around you. Opportunity lies in joining hands with others.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|3|9|Today may be one of those days in which you come to a four-way stop and no one knows whose turn it is. Don't sit and wait for everyone else to go first, Sagittarius. If you know it's your turn, be bold and make your move. It wouldn't be a bad idea to signal others that you're going ahead. People might not be used to you taking such an aggressive role.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|3|10|People would be foolish to challenge your thinking now, Capricorn. The power behind your words is volatile, and you may find yourself going to extremes in order to get your point across. Be careful about making promises you can't fulfill. It could be that you're so adamant about your point of view that you make up hyperbolic situations just to get your ideas across.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|3|11|Your old ways of thinking have carried you quite far, Aquarius, but you may now find that it's time to seek a new platform for your ideas. Look for more adventurous ways to express yourself. Break out of the old mold and try something new. Once you start in a brand new direction, there will be a great deal of support encouraging you to continue along that way.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|3|12|One quick phone call to a friend may turn into a long discussion about the meaning of life, Pisces. Be conscious of the fact that there's a great deal of momentum building in your mind now. Once the dam breaks, you may soon have a giant flood on your hands. Be careful about releasing all this energy at once, even though you may not seem to have a choice.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|4|1|There's apt to be a comfortable feeling about today that should make you feel quite secure and nurtured, Aries. Perhaps you're feeling protected by a strong force, maybe an internal one, that's reminding you that as long as you stay within the lines, everything will be fine. There's a familiarity to things that will make it easy for you to navigate any rough waters.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|4|2|You could feel like a rat in a maze today, Taurus. Walls and long, narrow corridors take you around corners and through doorways, yet there's no indication that you're going in the right direction. Instead of wandering aimlessly, stop and ask for help. You might not have noticed that if you look up, there are knowledgeable beings there who are willing to give you advice based on their lofty perspective.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|4|3|Don't get so stuck in your ways today that you insist on having the one true answer without really considering the options. You must be aware of a lot before you commit yourself one way or another. The people around you are apt to get annoyed with your narrow-mindedness, for this is how you will be viewed unless you stop and take a considered look at the whole picture.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|4|4|Quietly step into the background if things aren't going the way you'd like, Cancer. Don't try to stick your nose into someone else's business, even if you think you know the right way to proceed. People probably have strong opinions, and they won't be swayed in any direction. The best you can do is take care of yourself. You will probably find that this means you shouldn't be seen or heard.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|4|5|You may have gotten yourself tangled up in a deep mental drama over a series of recent incidents, Leo. Your mind may be working overtime in order to solve the riddles. It's quite possible that the reality of the situation is that you're simply making a big deal over nothing. Today is one of those days in which you will face the harsh reality that comes as a consequence of your over-the-top thinking.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|4|6|You may feel as if your smile is unwelcome today, Virgo. It may seem to you like there's some sort of gloom and doom to people's attitudes that makes them unwilling to accept any sort of good news. Don't let this stop you from maintaining your own cheerful state. It's important that you not probe too deeply into the reasons behind other people's behavior now.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|4|7|Keep careful track of things today, Libra, for you will find that the smallest detail will make the biggest difference. Don't hesitate to go with your hunches when something simply doesn't sound right. Stay focused and try not to get caught off guard when emotional issues come out of nowhere and disturb your thoughts. Trust yourself regardless of what's going on around you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|4|8|You may feel as if your hands are tied today and you're faced with absolutely no options, Scorpio. Don't despair over a situation that seems insurmountable. Think of yourself as a terrific magician who can burst out of the strongest chains. You have tricks up your sleeve that can help you escape just about any situation in which you find yourself.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|4|9|This is a good time to take a stand on an issue that you may have been vacillating about lately, Sagittarius. People will lose confidence in you if you can't seem to make up your mind. What they don't realize is that you've been working overtime to process all the information. Now it's time to express orally what you've discovered mentally.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|4|10|Today is one of those days in which you will be bursting at the seams to share big news with your friends, Capricorn. Perhaps you just received an important package or piece of information and you can't wait to spread the news. Be careful about who might be lurking around, however, because there could be others listening in. They may not necessarily be acting in your best interests.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|4|11|Your reluctance to speak could get you in trouble today, Aquarius. You may hesitate to share what you know for fear of what others might think. You should realize that you're using this as an excuse to hide what's really just selfishness. Share your knowledge with others and you will be amazed at the knowledge that comes back to you in return. Keep in mind that you may need to wait for it.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|4|12|"There may be a great tension between you and someone older today, Pisces. Perhaps there's someone who's adopting a sort of ""parent knows best"" personality that's starting to annoy you. Take a breather. Realize that this person isn't being critical or judgmental but just giving you advice. You should open your eyes and understand that this advice could be very useful.
                
               "|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|1|You're apt to get the feeling that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence today, Aries. Try not to get too hung up on this. Either make the effort to go where the landscape looks richer and more fruitful or stay where you are. The key to true happiness is to make sure that regardless of where you end up, you enjoy the spot where you are.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|2|Your mind may wander to a fantasyland full of castles, wizards, and magic dragons today, Taurus. You could find that you're putting yourself in the robes of a beautiful or handsome figure in a tall tower who's waiting for the perfect mate to come along. Observe the fanciful scenario you've created and see how the symbols and characters connect with your real life. Your imagination is trying to tell you something.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|5|3|Get on the fast track and use your powerful words and creative mind to make quick decisions that are mindful yet spontaneous. If you get in a pinch today, Gemini, don't worry about it. Simply relax, take a deep breath, and let your intuition guide you to the right path. Instead of wasting your energy thrashing helplessly in the water, call for help.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|5|4|Start the day with some vigorous yoga and then some meditation to help clear your mind, Cancer. Stretch your body and get the blood flowing through all of your limbs. Once your blood is flowing, your mind will get moving. Before it gets too far into its noisy routine, take the opportunity to maintain a quiet, serene state while you clear out the static and set forth your goals for the day.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|5|5|Do something for the community today, Leo, and really consider how your talents and skills can best be put to work. Consider volunteering at a school or library. Donate blood or help the elderly. Whatever you do, smile knowing that you're making direct contact with friends who need your assistance. Instead of just complaining about the way things are going, take a proactive role in leading the way toward a more philanthropic world.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|6|If you're having trouble tackling a giant problem, Virgo, don't get discouraged or overwhelmed. They key for you is to break things down into smaller chunks, analyze them, and figure out their role within the greater whole. You will find that by taking things one step at a time, any problem you encounter will be infinitely easier to overcome than you may have thought at first.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|5|7|It may seem like everyone around you is happy and getting what they want while you're stuck in the trenches, Libra. Don't compare yourself to other people and make judgments based on outside appearances. The truth of the matter is that they're most likely only looking at the immediate future and experiencing short-term pleasures. You, however, have your sights set on the long-term and will probably be much better off.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|8|Imagination and fantasy play a big part in your thinking today, Scorpio, and you shouldn't hesitate to embrace this frame of mind. There's a great deal of power to be drawn from your sense of freedom to explore and dream. Your thinking is more of a higher consciousness now. You should take advantage of this lofty perspective to see things from a neutral viewpoint.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|9|Engage more of your rational mind today, Sagittarius. If your mind continues on its track into a fantasy world, you might consider enlisting the help of people who can help you bring some discipline to your situation. For you, the general feeling of the day is likely to be that the mind is willing but the flesh is weak. Let others help you get inspired to get out of lazy mode.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|5|10|Suppose you were someone else for a day, Capricorn. How would it feel to be treated the way you normally treat other people? This is a good time to put yourself in someone else's shoes and experience life through their eyes. By doing this, you're apt to become more conscious of your own actions and the effect of those actions on the people around you.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|5|11|Today your thoughts may turn to fashion and the different ways in which you can improve your wardrobe. Don't be afraid to create a look that reflects your true inner spirit. Deck yourself in external splendor to illustrate the many different colors and layers that you carry on the inside. Don't hesitate to pick up a fashion magazine at the grocery store.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|5|12|The amazing thing about your nature is that, like a good politician, you have just the right tone of voice and catch phrase for every situation. You can put on your smile and charm and talk your way out of just about any pickle you get into. Embrace this incredible gift, but make sure that your overall goals are noble as opposed to self-serving or vengeful.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|1|Warm and sensitive by nature, Aries, today you could feel especially sensual. Sex and romance are likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies may seem especially appealing now, as could cozy beds and warm baths. Plan a romantic evening with the special person in your life, perhaps a special candlelit dinner at home.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|2|A minor accident might take place at home today, Taurus, but don't worry. It will ultimately provoke more laughter than harm. You will want the place to look great, Taurus, because a close friend or lover could come to visit. An intimate conversation or passionate encounter is indicated. Curb the temptation to indulge in too much food or drink.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|3|An unexpected package could arrive, possibly shipped from far away. The circumstances could be rather strange. Friends or relatives that you might not expect could suddenly show up, and you could spend a frantic hour or two organizing an impromptu party. This can be very gratifying, Gemini, but don't wear yourself out. Everyone should have a good time no matter what.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|4|Today you might strategize ways to make a little extra money to prepare to move ahead with your life and ambitions. This might be in conjunction with your significant other or some close friends. Trips to the mall might result in impulse purchases, as gifts or perhaps for yourself. In the evening, plan some time alone with your partner or get out and look for one if you're single.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|6|5|Your naturally passionate nature should be more aroused than usual today. The festive atmosphere around you gives rise to warm, intimate feelings that bring friends and couples closer together, Leo, so prepare for some good times out and excitement in the home tonight. Optimism and enthusiasm should fill the air. You will feel secure and comfortable yet crackling with ardor. Go for it!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|6|6|An intense card, email, or phone call could come from a sibling or other relative today. Perhaps this is a good chance to patch up an old quarrel with this person, but don't be tempted to start another! Emotions are running high now, Virgo, and it wouldn't take much to set someone off. You might want to go out and do a little shopping, but be careful. Traffic could be bad.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|6|7|A proposed visit to a friend's may have to be delayed, and this might worry you. It will be necessary to make a special effort to get almost anything done today, Libra. You could have some urgent chores to complete, but the streets and stores may be full of impatient people. Relax, breathe deeply, and summon every bit of energy you have. You don't want to put anything off now.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|6|8|A love relationship could take on a higher and more spiritual aspect during this period, creating a desire for your souls to bond. The planetary atmosphere brings you closer together, and you may experience a closer sense of intimacy. You two might spend time with mutual friends today, enjoying yourselves, but at the same time anxious to be alone. Bask in the glow.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|9|The planetary energy might find you responding to a sudden sense of inspiration that arouses your creativity. You may feel an unexpected urge to write, paint, draw, or compose some music. You may want to sequester yourself, which could cause some problems with friends and family members who want to be with you. Don't ignore this impetus, Sagittarius. As you know, inspiration can vanish as quickly as it comes.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|6|10|You've been very busy, professionally and socially, and now you're probably longing for a romantic encounter. If you're currently involved, you should schedule some time alone with the special person in your life. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if someone new appears on the scene. You could fall in love at first sight or an old friend could suddenly look different to you. Make sure you look your best!|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|6|11|You're likely to want to spend some time alone with your partner today, Aquarius, but with the current planetary influences at play, either you or your honey's career concerns could get in the way. An unexpected opportunity needs to be explored right away, so you might not be able to spend any time together now. Contact with friends could also prove frustrating since everyone is busy.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|6|12|A co-worker might be away, and this could increase the amount of work that you have to do, causing strain and upset, especially if you aren't familiar with the work. Don't try to do it all at once. A distant family member you haven't heard from for a while could phone out of the blue, and you could spend a happy half hour catching up.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|1|While you normally like all of your romantic relationships to be extremely nurturing and comforting, you may find that this isn't always possible, Aries. There's a disconnect between you and a close partner right now that could be hard to rectify. Time is really the only thing that's likely to resolve this sort of problem. Remember that all of your relationships can't always go exactly according to plan.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|2|A creative project that you've been working on may be coming to a climactic peak now, Taurus. Discuss your progress with others and feel free to hold an informal critique in order to get honest feedback on your work. A piece of art should stir some sort of reaction inside another person. Consider ways in which you can challenge the people around you with your talent.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|3|Be aware that love is likely to wear some sort of disguise today, Gemini. There's something fanciful about the way in which this new romance will manifest, so get ready. Don't think that love always has to be planned and calculated. There is a strong sense of spontaneity associated with the delicious love interest of the day. Don't dismiss those who don't seem practical or levelheaded enough for you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|7|4|Take your loved one out for a romantic dinner tonight, Cancer. Escort him or her on a magic-carpet ride to fantastic places that encourage a playful mood and carefree attitude. Consider having a bottle of wine at a playground. Decorate your house with candles and burn some incense. Create a mood that will calm the nerves and soothe the soul. Your sense of romance is right on target.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|7|5|When it comes to romantic relationships, Leo, you might find that you're playing more of a game of hide-and-go-seek than a combined effort toward friendship, trust, and honesty. It could be that you're purposely trying to hide in order to test the stamina of your opponent. You might want to take a new approach now, one that involves an effort toward connecting instead of distancing.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|7|6|You're apt to be somewhat fickle when it comes to love and romance right now, Virgo. The key for you now is freedom. The problem with this mindset is that it might be misinterpreted. Your partner may think you simply aren't interested in him or her anymore. Remind your partner that it's OK to love someone while also needing time and space to do things on your own.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|7|7|You may be confused when it comes to matters of the heart, Libra. Perhaps you feel cheated when the object of your desire doesn't give you complete attention at all times. The fundamental security of your being is your responsibility, not someone else's. Find a way to incorporate your dreams into the dreams of others instead of always working toward goals at opposite sides of the spectrum.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|8|Your fairytale imagination of how your romantic life should run is hooking you up with many different opportunities, Scorpio. Whether you realize it or not, the optimal situation you seek is within your grasp. Make sure that you aren't trying to manipulate a certain person into becoming the person you want him or her to be. If you're unhappy in your relationship, perhaps you need to find someone new.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|7|9|Your dreams work out quite nicely in your head, Sagittarius, but the problem now is how to turn them into some sort of real life scenario. Be careful of taking too intellectual of an approach. When it comes to relationships, things don't normally happen logically or rationally. You're going to have to leave a great deal up to chance, so just learn to deal with things as they come.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|7|10|Love and personal relationships are likely to take on a much dreamier and more romantic tone now, Capricorn.

The unmistakable glow that surrounds you is likely to attract others to your side even if you aren't in the market for a romantic relationship right now.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|11|When it comes to relationships with others, be careful about insisting that everything be done only your way, Aquarius. It could be that you have such high expectations of your partner that he or she will never be able to live up to your standards. Basically, you're setting the stage for failure by demanding that the person for you be of a certain make and model.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|7|12|Your fantasies could come true now, especially when it comes to relationships, Pisces. This could be the moment you've always dreamed about, so get ready. The attractive, romantic person in the corner has been keeping an eye on you all night. Your blood is pumping faster than ever. Remind yourself that all dreams can come true on a day such as today.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|1|Romantic relationships may not exactly be going as well as you'd like, Aries, but don't get discouraged. Hang in there and you will find that things eventually come around your way. You may need to strengthen your internal sense of confidence, since it's doubtful that you will get much support from interactions with the people around you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|8|2|It could be that you're trying to communicate with someone in a matter regarding love and romance and it simply isn't working. You're apt to feel like you need a translator in order to get your message across. Both you and your partner need to share responsibility for making sure that the lines of communication remain open. Be practical yet sensitive in your approach.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|3|This is a fantastic time for you for love and romance, Gemini, even if there's a bit of coolness between you and the person you care about. It's possible that there needs to be an element of distance now for you to really appreciate the good thing you have. If you aren't involved with someone now, you should find that you're in a good position to make a move toward someone you feel strongly about.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|8|4|It's one thing to be a friend and it's another to feed someone's ego just to make him or her happy, Cancer. Make sure that you aren't telling someone lies just because you know that that is what he or she wants to hear. A true friend is someone who is honest at all times, even if it means that you may temporarily hurt that person's feelings.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|5|It's critical that you not try to gain the love and appreciation of another by controlling their decisions, Leo. It's time to let the people around you set their own rules and boundaries. Give that special person space to decide what's best, then you can take action accordingly. It may be that you discover things about this person that you probably would never have known if you called all the shots.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|6|You might need to put on the brakes today when it comes to love and romance, Virgo. Don't think that this means you have to break off any sort relationship that's in the works, but realize that you may need to take a more realistic approach to how you handle it. The problem is that you may be getting so caught up in the fantasy of things that you aren't tending to practicalities.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|8|7|Things should be going quite well for you today, Libra, and you will find that aspects of your life that may have felt disconnected in the past are finally slipping into place. Have faith that all your painstaking planning and organizing is finally going to pay off. This is especially true in love and romance. Spend intimate time with a close partner tonight.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|8|8|Restriction and discipline might not be your forte, Scorpio, but realize that this may be exactly the type of thing that you need the most. Try not to expend your energy in too many directions. Focus and channel your efforts into the things you consider the most important. Make sure that most of your day is spent tending to these things. Have you hugged your loved ones lately?|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|9|Appreciate the good things you have today, Sagittarius. Don't let another day go by without really paying homage to the people who've helped you grow along the way. Take a walk. Climb a tree or help a child build a tree house. Connect with your spiritual side that finds satisfaction in where you are now instead of always feeling a need to search for something bigger and better.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|8|10|When it comes to matters of love and romance, you may need to tone things down a bit, Capricorn. An aggressive approach now may drive your loved one further away from you instead of drawing him or her closer. Remember that love is a two-way street. Don't just do things the way you'd like to do them. It's crucial that you consider your partner's thoughts and feelings every step of the way.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|8|11|You may find that your love is incredibly magnetic now, Aquarius. All you need to do is be yourself and suddenly people flock your way. There are terrific opportunities for you to strengthen the bonds you have with the people you care about the most. Solidify your relationship with soft romantic words and actions. There is an extra sensuality to your mood and actions now.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|8|12|Consider taking a more conservative approach to your actions today, Pisces, as well as to the way you dress. Others may be rather put off by something that comes across as too flashy. Fashion is apt to be a significant concern for you now, which is fine. Don't underestimate the power of personal appearance.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|1|You're likely to gravitate toward those who can put on a show and carry your imagination to a far-off land today, Aries. Look for this quality in others instead of turning to the TV to satisfy this need. If you aren't careful, you may end up a couch potato all day, without talking to anyone. Take note that real life is much more enriching that anything that could come over the airwaves.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|2|Connect with those who carry you upward and encourage your fantasies today instead of those who try to bring you down to reality, Taurus. There's a need for you to shine more brightly than usual, and there's no reason why this wish shouldn't be granted. Everything will work out splendidly for you as long as you align yourself with admirable people and noble causes, so go for it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|9|3|You're likely now on the brink of completing a major move of some sort. Your first reaction may be to sit in solitary deliberation as you wrestle with the pros and cons of each piece of the situation. Try not to overload your head with too many details. Look at the overall picture. Perhaps you will find the answer you seek on a walk. During that time you can clear your head of unnecessary clutter.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|4|This is one of those days when you will be walking along and all of a sudden hear a street performer playing music. Suddenly your feet start to move and soon you're dancing. You find yourself boogying down the rest of the road. It won't take much to get you grooving. Once you start, it may be hard for you to stop. Go with it!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|5|Don't take things that don't belong to you, Leo. Your penetrating eyes are apt to spot things that are easily pocketed, even though you know deep down that those things aren't meant for you to keep. Your imagination might try to convince you that it's OK to pull such sneaky maneuvers, and you may be tempted. Don't deceive yourself.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|9|6|"Try not to think too much about what is ""supposed"" to happen next, Virgo. The truth of the matter is that things don't necessarily work out the way they're planned, so don't count on something that has no guarantee of coming to fruition. Stick to your own way of doing things and try not to get too hung up on the results. The key now is to enjoy the process.
                
               "|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|9|7|Water your plants today and make sure they're getting enough light, Libra. If you don't have any plants, take this opportunity to go to the nursery and pick up a couple for your home or office. Nourish the organic things in your life to help remind you of your own roots, which are extremely important for you right now. Sink deep into the Earth in order to understand the environment around you.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|8|You're on a roll today, Scorpio. Don't let other people's insecurities or shallow understanding about an issue get in the way of your progress. There's a distinct advantage to the way you approach things. Feel free to exert your will on those who need strong direction. If you're confident about the answer, don't be shy about saying so. If people don't like the way you're leading, they don't need to follow.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|9|9|You may be wondering whose shoulder you should cry on, Sagittarius. Usually yours is the shoulder that everyone else likes to use. The collar of your shirt is probably soaking wet by now, thanks to all the tears that have spilled on you. Your compassion for others is definitely one of your biggest strengths, but be aware of the fact that it can also be one of your biggest weaknesses.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|9|10|Your coals have been smoldering for a while, and there is a great deal of smoke pouring from your blackened embers, Capricorn. The good news is that there's apt to be a great gust of wind today, acting as the catalyst that ignites the flames. You've provided the heat and the fuel. The missing element of air is finally coming your way, so be prepared. The fire is apt to heat up quickly.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|11|Be wary of big promises today, Aquarius. This could be one of those days when people are more likely to take a gamble because they're unrealistic about how things are going to work out. Don't be surprised if the stock market jumps as a result of the dollar signs that people imagine. It will be hard for others to resist when people receive promises of a big payoff.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|9|12|Feel free to go shopping for yourself, Pisces. While you're at it, you might as well pick up some things for others, too. You're apt to be in tune with the pleasant spirit of the people around you. On the other hand, if they're being especially negative or cranky, don't hesitate to just go elsewhere. Unfortunately, that may be easier said than done.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|10|1|Your mood should be quite good for the most part, Aries, but there's apt to be some tension in your relationships. Romantic endeavors aren't exactly in your favor now, so don't force an issue that seems too difficult to resolve. Find comfort in your internal warmth. By taking the time to nurture yourself, you will inevitably have more love to give to the people around you.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|10|2|There's a deep longing to be comforted and reassured, Taurus. You may want nothing more than for someone fix you some warm, homemade soup. If this is the case, feel free to call and ask a good friend to come over. Don't continue to play the part of the strong, independent one if this isn't the way you feel. If you aren't honest about your needs, it will be impossible for anyone to know how to fulfill them.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|10|3|You may feel like you desperately need something, Gemini, yet you're unsure as to what it is exactly. Someone close to you may be trying to fit the missing puzzle piece into place, but this may be next to impossible if it's unclear which piece is actually missing. This difficult situation may lead to frustration if you aren't careful. Feel free to admit that you feel powerless. Don't be ashamed to say so.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|10|4|You may want to remedy every situation by talking things out or taking some sort of action, Cancer. Be careful of making any sudden moves before you really understand what you're feeling. One minute you may be full of exuberance and ready to launch into a new project, but once you start moving forward, you're suddenly feeling insecure. Take this resistance as a sign that maybe this isn't the best time to move forward.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|10|5|Compliments are apt to feel like gold to you, Leo. There's nothing you need more than love and affection on a day like this. Beware that you may end up as putty in the hands of whoever showers you with flattery. You may also resent this need for attention and not be willing to receive it graciously. This isn't the right attitude. Receive accolades with open arms and offer an equal amount of affection in return.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|10|6|If you find that there's tension in a close relationship, you may get the feeling that this isn't the right partner for you, Virgo. Don't automatically assume that the problem lies in your partner. Difficult situations involving the need for love and affection are likely to emerge regardless of the situation or the company. Instead of running to the next person, take the time to work things out.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|10|7|When tension builds, your sense of security is likely to falter, Libra. You may have a hard time dealing with other people. You could be tempted to turn to food or alcohol for inner nourishment. Curing emotional needs by indulging this way may temper your ailment for a while, but it isn't the solution to the overall problem. Work out the bugs with the people involved, and don't try to do it on an empty stomach.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|10|8|You might have difficulty expressing your needs, Scorpio. The bottom line is that there's no right or wrong way, although it may be difficult to see this on a day like today. Deep-seated insecurity may make expressing yourself difficult. At a time when you feel like you should politely take things in, you really may be feeling like you want to run from the people around you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|10|9|Although you may find it hard to express yourself in some ways, Sagittarius, the one avenue that's completely wide open today is art. Difficult tension is laced with emotional insecurity, making it hard for you to express your feelings. If you feel that this is the case, find some other means of expressing these emotions. A large canvas and some paints will work quite nicely.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|10|10|You might be feeling rather insecure when it comes to your peace of mind, Capricorn. Because of the insecurity, it may seem like your relationships are on the rocks. At the same time, having problems in your relationships is making you less likely to trust these close partners with your insecure feelings. Talking about your emotions in an honest manner will help you break out of this difficult situation.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|10|11|You may feel more reserved than usual, Aquarius, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. You may be feeling apprehensive about expressing yourself fully, even in the most intimate situations. Be careful about sending messages that suggest that you don't want to be around others. People are apt to think they're to blame for your reluctance. It's fine to be a recluse, but don't completely alienate yourself in the process.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|10|12|Be careful about being too boisterous and chipper around people who don't exactly feel the same way, Pisces. Be sensitive to other people's feelings, and don't make jokes that are too harsh for the occasion. No one appreciates a wise guy. There's a somber mood to the day that's likely to form a dark cloud by late afternoon. Do your best to be the ray of sunshine and not the bolt of lightning.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|1|Worries about money that may have preoccupied you for the past day or so could prove unfounded, Aries. This should come as a real relief to you, although it may be difficult to grasp at first. Your mind is still getting in the way of accepting it. Go over your correspondence and bank records as many times as you want. The answer should be the same - all is better than you thought.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|11|2|A temporary separation from your romantic partner could have you agitated, Taurus. Are you worried that your friend has forgotten you? This is probably an overreaction, but your insecurities are getting the better of you. Find a distraction. Have faith. Phone calls from your friend should prove reassuring. Perhaps the only way to get past this is to stay busy until your partner returns.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|11|3|Are things getting a little bit crazy, Gemini? Too many tasks and too many people vying for your attention could have your nerves stretched as taut as violin strings. Try to get outside for a while. Treat yourself to a nice lunch or do a little shopping. Take a good long nap. Whatever seems so urgent isn't worth sacrificing your peace of mind. Try to stay focused!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|4|A rush of creative inspiration could take you temporarily away from your social life today, Cancer. At some point you could be working as if there were no tomorrow, perhaps worrying that you will forget it if you don't get it all down now. It's no use telling you to slow down. Be sure to keep sufficient snacks on hand, and do take occasional breaks. Work hard and good luck!|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|11|5|An impromptu party may take place at your house today when some unexpected but welcome visitors turn up at your door. Expect the conversation to alternate between lots of laughs and discussion of some pretty serious subjects. The gathering could continue well into the night if you let it, but don't let it continue past the point of enjoyment. You can always do it again another time.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|11|6|Is a new neighbor moving in nearby, Virgo? This person could come from a very interesting locale, so you might want to get to know him or her. Don't expect to be able to do this today. This person may be in and out throughout the afternoon and too busy with settling in. Drop some cookies off some time over the next few days, however. You will be glad you did.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|7|Have you been spending too much lately, Libra? Today you could be feeling the effects of it. You may have to wait to make a purchase that you've wanted for a long time, and this could be frustrating. Don't worry about it, though. You will get through this unscathed, and the item will still be in the store when you have money again. Relax.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|8|Your sweetheart may seem upset today and unlikely to want to talk about it, Scorpio. This could prove frustrating for you, since you don't like to be kept in the dark. Take care to avoid giving in to the temptation to push. This won't make your partner any more likely to share, and it could drive a wedge between you. Just hang in there and let your friend talk when the time is right.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|11|9|Vague aches and pains could have you feeling a little under the weather, Sagittarius. You may not be able to discern why you have these pains, since there's no apparent reason. Don't assume the worst. Your condition is probably just due to a little intensified nerve strain and extra stress. Take it easy and relax today. Go back to your usual routine tomorrow.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|11|10|Expect some delays, upsets, and unexpected turns when it comes to romance today, Capricorn. Jealousy may rear its ugly head, as you may at some point get the impression that your beloved is noticing someone else. Bear in mind that there's a strong chance that these impressions are illusory, and that the truth may be totally different from the way things seem. Take care to stay focused. Reserve judgment until you know the facts.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|11|Changes may be taking place on the home front, Aquarius, perhaps unexpected repairs or someone moving in or out. Your household could seem frenetic and disorganized until the dust settles, which doesn't sit well with your love of peace and quiet. Whatever needs to be done is best accomplished one step at a time, with your mind focused on the results. It will help you stay sane!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|11|12|An unexpected and perhaps not altogether welcome call could come your way today, Pisces. It could come from someone you don't particularly care for or someone who has some disconcerting news to report. Whichever it is, you will probably just have to deal with it. However you may feel about the caller or what he or she has to report, you will probably consider it important to have the conversation.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|1|You generally tend to be sensitive and intuitive, Aries, but today you might be even more so. Reading about people from other places and times might cause you to tune into their thoughts and feelings and receive new insight into human nature. Creative projects, particularly writing, benefit from this. If you want to remember what you come up with, write it down.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|2|A group meeting or social event could bring up so many new and interesting ideas that you may not be able to digest them all, Taurus. Some new friends who share your interests might want to continue the discussions. Your mind is especially quick today. You could well grasp unusual concepts that usually don't interest you. But watch your step - you might be so preoccupied that you could have an accident.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|12|3|A lot of paperwork might need attention today, Gemini. You might throw a lot of your focus and energy into getting it all done. Stimulating conversations with colleagues could keep your mind occupied so you avoid boredom. You could take a walk at the end of the day, since you're apt to encounter so much new information that you will want to clear your head in order to absorb it all.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|12|4|Expanding your mind could be of interest today, Cancer. You might decide to travel to a place you've always wanted to visit. Or you could decide to go back to school for an advanced degree. Either way, you're likely to spend the day considering the idea and doing a lot of research. At some point you will want to go for a workout to rid your system of some of the day's tension.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|5|Generally, Leo, you tend to be interested in what makes everything tick, from the human mind to the workings of the Universe to religion. Today that interest could be piqued by something you read or hear. You might want to delve into a field of interest and learn whatever you can about it. You could have some insights that are as valid as anyone else's, so write them down!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|12|6|Stimulating conversations could take place with partners of all sorts, Virgo, from business to exercise to romantic. Some new and useful information could come your way that you will want to explore further. This is a great day to execute legal papers or enter into any kind of agreement or commitment. It's a good time to sign up for a class or workshop. Make good use of the energies of the day.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|12|7|Some stimulating discussions could take place today. Your energy is likely to be very high, Libra. You may want to throw yourself into your work, particularly if it involves paperwork. You might also want to go for a workout, try your hand at writing, or read about the latest discoveries concerning optimal health. Books, magazines, and the Internet could prove especially useful.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|8|Today you might decide to do some writing, Scorpio. This could be job related, but it's more likely personal, either correspondence with friends and colleagues or creative. Some stimulating discussion could take place with friends, romantic partners, or children that could set your mind buzzing with new ideas. This is a great day to attend or participate in a sporting event.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|9|Some people who share your interests could visit your home today. You might want to take a walk or otherwise exercise together, but you will probably get into some stimulating debates. Don't be surprised if everyone talks at once! New books that you will want to read could come to your attention. In the evening, rent some videos on whatever subject you've discussed.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|12|10|Your mind will be especially quick and active today, Capricorn, and you're likely to want to spend much of the day involved in intellectual activities like reading, writing, or teaching. Communication with others should be a powerful part of your day, so you will probably spend time on the phone. You will want to write down many of the ideas you hear. You will find most of them interesting and want to remember them.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|12|11|Today you might decide to tackle your financial paperwork and get it all done. This is a great day for that, Aquarius, although you might be a little too ambitious and not get as much done as you'd like. This is a good time to make use of any writing talent, because ideas could be coming to you thick and fast. Expect many of letters or phone calls in this busy and stimulating day.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|12|12|Your mind is usually quick, agile, and hungry for information, Pisces. Today it's likely to be even more so than usual. Your curiosity is high and you could go to unusual lengths to satisfy it. You might also feel particularly energetic and want to go for a workout. This is a good idea. Exercise can clear your head and give you a better perspective on new ideas and information.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|13|1|A goal that you've been working on could finally be reached, Aries. A group of friends you might not have seen for a long time could schedule a get-together that you will be all too glad to attend. Expect to have a lot of fun exchanging news and ideas with these people. You will probably feel particularly happy to see them. You won't want to let so much time go by before you reconnect again.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|13|2|Today you could meet some interesting new people, Taurus. Among them is at least one person who shares a lot of your interests and could become a close friend. The joy you receive from meeting these people is likely to spill over into the rest of your day. You could be warmer and more congenial with everyone else in your life, too. In the evening, go out and have some fun.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|13|3|A book or movie about a foreign country could capture your imagination and make that country seem especially appealing, Gemini. You might toy with the idea of taking a trip there soon. If you're serious, it might be a good idea to start making your plans. You're in a particularly practical frame of mind and have the enthusiasm to do it. Have fun browsing through travel brochures and maps.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|13|4|Someone close who owes you money might suddenly turn up and repay you, Cancer. This might be a surprise, but you will be glad to get it. You may want to blow some of it by taking a friend out to lunch or buying someone a gift. Some beautiful dreams could haunt your sleep tonight, perhaps to the point where you feel frustrated when you wake up. Write them down. They're saying something about you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|13|5|Today you should feel especially warm and loving toward everyone close to you, Leo, particularly a love partner. You may want to spend some time with friends or family or schedule a romantic evening with your significant other - or both. If you have paperwork to take care of, this is the day to do it. You're particularly practical and feeling good, so the drudgery won't get you down.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|13|6|You should be looking especially attractive today and glowing with robust health, Virgo. You're apt to feel warm and loving, particularly toward small animals. If you've considered adopting a pet, this is a good day to do it. Business, work, and money matters continue to go well. You should be in a pretty good space. This frame of mind should last you a long time.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|13|7|Today you should be feeling especially warm and loving toward close friends and children, Libra. You could also especially appreciate the arts. You might attend a play or concert or decide to try your hand at one of the fine arts yourself. In the evening, go out and enjoy your friends' company. Celebrate just being together!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|13|8|Today you might decide to buy a plant for every room in your house or plant a garden, Scorpio. If the weather is good, you might visit a nursery or botanical garden. You may not normally be attracted to plants and gardens, but today both beauty and nature seem especially appealing. Make the most of this, however temporary. Your house will look that much more beautiful because of it!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|13|9|A warm and loving communication could come to you today from someone close. This could be an email, call, or even a gift of some kind. This could make your day, Sagittarius, and you will probably pass whatever good feelings you draw from it to other friends and family members. Take a walk around your neighborhood and say hello to whomever you meet. It will make you feel even better!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|13|10|A very welcome sum of extra money could come your way today, Capricorn, possibly out of the blue. You might want to put this money to work for you in some way, perhaps investing it or purchasing supplies or materials for personal projects. You should feel especially positive where your resources are concerned, and confident in your ability to earn.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|13|11|Today you may feel especially warm and loving toward just about everybody in your circle, Aquarius, even those you usually find irritating. You could also be looking especially attractive and feeling more confident than usual. You might even feel like shopping for new clothes. Artistic ideas could flow freely, and you might think of different ways to put them to work for you.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|13|12|Someone you care about but haven't seen for a long time could suddenly contact you. You'd usually love this, Pisces, but today you could be too caught up in projects of your own to want to put them aside. But you will have a lot of fun with this person, and you might even interest him or her in your project. After finishing your work, go out to dinner.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|1|Your natural warmth is enhanced by a new sense of self-confidence, Aries. Group activities and social events might bring you into touch with people who prove to be valuable business contacts.

Make the most of it!|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|14|2|Today you might pinch yourself to see if what you're experiencing is real, Taurus. Success and good fortune are coming thick and fast, with only minor setbacks and irritations to complicate matters. Business, money, and career success are likely to be at an all-time high, although you might find yourself feeling a little fearful of what comes next. Don't worry about that. Go with the flow.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|3|Career and financial success might have paved the way for you to fulfill some of your fondest dreams, Gemini. Perhaps you've wanted to return to college and get an advanced degree, take a trip around the world, or try writing and publishing. Whatever it is, your schedule should be freer and more flexible than ever, so this is the time to go for it. Start planning today!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|14|4|Now that you feel more secure regarding your business and financial situations, Cancer, you might be looking for ways to feed your spiritual and metaphysical interests. Your intuitive and psychic abilities should be operating at a very high level, causing you to experience some vivid dreams and visions and receive the insights that come from them. Books and lectures might prove especially enlightening.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|14|5|Just about every department of life should be going very well for you now, Leo.

You might be thinking of expanding your horizons through new enterprises or study. Don't be shy - go for it.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|6|Whatever you're working on at the moment, Virgo, whether business related, personal projects, or volunteer work, it's likely to bring you increased satisfaction on many levels. You're enjoying what you do, making a difference, and meeting new friends. Your health continues to glow. You may feel as if nothing can stop you. Watch out for minor upsets, but nothing that will burst your bubble.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|7|It's likely that your personal and creative horizons are expanding, Libra. Your or another's artistic enterprises might pay off big today.

Your new feeling of enthusiasm and self-confidence certainly doesn't hurt!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|14|8|A huge get-together of some kind could take place today either at your home or the home of someone close to you, Scorpio. It's possible this may turn into more than just a fun party. You might become involved in conversations with people who become valuable business or social contacts. Expect to have a wonderful time no matter what you do today.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|14|9|Expect many advantageous changes to take place in your community, Sagittarius. New businesses could open their doors, interesting neighbors could move in, or some necessary repairs could finally get done.

An exciting proposition may come to you or someone close to you through a letter, email, or phone call.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|10|You've probably had few periods when business and finance have gone well for you, Capricorn. Now this trend seems to be coming to a head. Today you might start or close some type of agreement that will make a big difference to your finances. Your money situation should not only improve but also stabilize at a level higher than it's ever been. As long as you're diligent, this growth should continue.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|14|11|You tend to be practical and businesslike by nature, Aquarius, but the tremendous growth you've experienced may increase your desire to be as sensible and efficient as possible in order to continue this trend. You're feeling upbeat and positive. You're likely to continue to feel this way. The only downside is that you're probably going to be working very hard. You will like the results, though, so go for it.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|14|12|You probably think of yourself as a curious intellectual, Pisces, but a recent expansion in career and finance has brought out talents for business and money that you didn't know you had. This has been a time not only of success and good fortune but also of learning more about yourself. Don't fall back on old fears or underestimate yourself. You're capable of accomplishing more than you know.|Scorpio|Taurus|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|15|1|You're finally on the mend, Aries. The minor ailments that may have dragged you down lately are beginning to disappear. You're about to regain all of your physical energy. If you overindulge, your energy level is likely to plummet once again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|15|2|Do you feel a little under the weather today, Taurus? It's quite possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from such storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down. It's worry about the future that drains your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|15|3|There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension. Did you have some intellectual disagreement? In any case, it looks as though your self-confidence is stronger than ever right now. Go ahead and express any complaints or opinions you may have been keeping to yourself, Gemini. But try and do it gently, especially where family is concerned.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|15|4|It seems that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Cancer. You continue to go through the daily motions and do what you planned on doing, but it seems as though your heart is no longer in it. Don't ask why. It's just that you've been working hard and thinking hard lately. You've reached your limit and it's time to rest.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|15|5|You may have been spending or saving too much money, Leo. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than frustration. It's a curious phenomenon, as though you've lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|15|6|Perhaps you've been impatiently waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures after your meditation during the last few months. Know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains to be done. Gather your strength and get ready to take action with renewed vigor.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|15|7|If you find yourself tired and irritable at the moment, Libra, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few weeks that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue on the same path? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to serious physical exhaustion, Libra. You'll be even more frustrated if you get sick. So be wise and take care of your basic needs.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|15|8|This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Scorpio. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked too long on a painting, which is to take a step back. You need to see people, travel, go to the theater, and clear your head. This is never easy for you, but do it anyway. Afterwards you'll think it was the best thing for you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|15|9|This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Sagittarius. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|15|10|You took off like a bullet a few days ago, making great progress in a short amount of time. Now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all of your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up, Capricorn. Rethink your strategy.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|15|11|There is some likelihood that you will be haunted by thoughts of your love life today, Aquarius. Perhaps you're intrigued by the idea of exploring certain secret realms of your relationship, yet you aren't sure how to communicate this to your mate. Perhaps you're still testing the waters, waiting until you know how you feel. In any case, you might make a decision to proceed today.|Libra|Aries|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|15|12|Today, more than ever, you will yearn to escape the daily routine, Pisces. You thirst for new sights and sounds, new faces and new places, but you know you must juggle your desires with professional and domestic obligations. It isn't always easy. Trust your imagination to find a way to settle this conflict.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|1|An intriguing new neighbor, perhaps someone you're attracted to, could move in near you, Aries. This might prove very exciting.

2016|10|16|2|Your intuitive abilities should be operating at a very high level today, Taurus.

These insights could be a source of inspiration that propels you to accomplish wonders in some aspect of your life. This could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy! Make the most of it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|16|3|A friend could introduce you to an exciting new person for whom you feel a very powerful physical attraction, Gemini. This meeting could prove exciting, but stay calm and remain objective. If your feelings are too obvious, he or she could well lose interest before anything has time to develop! Just be yourself, enjoy the company, and have fun. That's all you need do at this point.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|4|Some exciting career developments could have you flying high today, Cancer. Perhaps you've just reached a long-term goal or managed to get a break that tells you that your goals are now within reach. Whichever it is, you're likely to be on the receiving end of some congratulations, perhaps from unexpected people. More income could also be in the offing. Whatever it is, you've earned it!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|5|Tonight you might decide to attend a group activity of some kind, perhaps one concerned with philosophical or spiritual matters, Leo. Everyone who attends is apt to feel very strongly about the subject, so discussions could prove lively and exciting. Your mind could be spinning like a top when you leave, so if you can, walk home so you can clear your head. Write down your thoughts. You will want to remember them.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|16|6|Your financial situation could be greatly boosted by a development you hadn't expected, Virgo. Perhaps some investments suddenly skyrocket in value, or maybe the homes in your neighborhood are suddenly worth more than you thought. Whichever it is, don't try to cash in on it right now. Chances are the value of your investment will continue to increase. Hang in there and watch it grow.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|16|7|A legal matter that may have been pending for a while could finally be completed today, Libra. It's very likely to go in your favor. Therefore, if you've been sitting on a contract, agreement, or other document that needs your signature, read it carefully before you sign. You will probably get what you want out of the transaction. By the way, this is also a great day to get married!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|8|Your physical energy is likely to be high today, Scorpio, so you might not feel like staying indoors. Take care of your body first, and get in a good workout. You may also want to explore, perhaps by driving out of town for the day or going to an amusement park. You may not feel this energetic very often, so it's best to make the most of it when you can.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|16|9|An exciting rush of physical passion could hit you today when you're introduced to an interesting new person, Sagittarius. Take care not to wear it on your face. You generally don't like to reveal that much of yourself! Besides, you won't want this person to think you're too obvious. Try to stay focused and remain objective. Then consider whether it's a good idea to pursue this attraction.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|10|Chores that need to be done around the house could be at the top of your priority list today, Capricorn. A female visitor, perhaps your mother, could come by and making your place look great will preoccupy you. Don't do any more work than you absolutely have to. You won't want to be too tired when she arrives.|Virgo|Pisces|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|16|11|Today you may have some important phone calls to make, Aquarius, and want to get them out of the way before doing anything else.

Words combine with feelings to create understanding between you and just about anyone, whether you're talking on the phone or writing.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|16|12|Good news about money could create some excitement in your household today, Pisces. One of your goals might be to invest some of the funds in fixing up your living situation. You might even consider moving or purchasing a new home. You may kick around a lot of ideas about how to spend the windfall, but don't go too crazy. Hold on to some of that money as a nest egg.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|17|1|Do your best to keep up today, Aries. Things might move quickly. You may be raising your hand and waiting politely for someone to call on you. This is one of those days in which other people will be so concerned about themselves that they probably won't notice you at all. If you want to take your turn, you should probably just stand up and be proactive.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|17|2|This is a good time to take control of the situation, Taurus. You've done your preparation and now it's time to put it to good use. You're about to face your enemy eye to eye. Have confidence in your training. There's an extra alertness to you that helps you fight any battles. You have a strong awareness of the energy around you, so use this to your advantage.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|17|3|Don't be surprised if the old-fashioned, practical solution doesn't make the grade today, Gemini. Probably the new devices and special electronic shortcuts will be the most impressive thing going. This is the classic case of the new, improved version replacing the old, slow one. You need to upgrade your system sooner or later, so you might as well do it now.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|17|4|You may be able to zip through chores like lightning today, Cancer. There's an added swiftness to your step that helps in every one of your endeavors. You might want to engage in just about every activity except work. This is completely understandable. You will feel much better if you get your work done first and then socialize. That plan will produce the best results.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|17|5|You're likely to go to extremes today on many levels, Leo. The problem is that you may encounter opposition everywhere you turn. There's an incredible stubbornness to the day that is evident in everyone's mood, especially yours. Keep in mind that if you want cooperation and resolution, you will need to compromise. Try to see other people's needs as well.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|17|6|Grab hold of the day's boisterous energy and run with it, Virgo. This is a good time to kick up your heels and have fun. You might find that people are a bit more high-strung than usual, so you may need to use your ability to go with the flow. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed others will be when they're around you.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|17|7|You might be frustrated by the fact that people are doing things hastily today, Libra. You might have to accept the fast-paced energy of the day just so you can keep up. Don't worry if you engage in activities that aren't carefully planned beforehand. You will find spontaneous frivolity to be extremely rewarding on a day like this. Expect the unexpected.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|17|8|People may come into conflict with you today, Scorpio. More than likely, the issue at hand will have to do with others being a bit too focused on themselves, while you're more concerned with the collective. Try to be a bit more understanding as people demand more of your attention. There's an unmistakable passion in the air that will grant you more zest for life.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|17|9|Jump-start the day with a smile, Sagittarius. Your generosity and sincerity won't go unnoticed on a day like this.

Fill yourself up with the lively, fun-loving energy of the day.|Leo|Aquarius|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|17|10|There could be an unexpected tension coming out of nowhere today, Capricorn. More than likely your emotions will be running at a high level. It could be that your aggressiveness and assertiveness start to annoy others. People might snap suddenly. Don't be surprised if things come without much warning. There is a fast-paced feeling to the day that will be hard to ignore.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|17|11|Your slow and steady approach might be met with a bit of opposition today, Aquarius. People could be demanding of your time and energy. It's one of those days in which the people behind you in line at a coffee shop might give you dirty looks if you take too long to make up your mind.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|17|12|This is a terrific day for you, Pisces, and you will find that the fast pace of the day suits you well for what you need to get done.

Put on a lavish display wherever you go.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|18|1|Information you receive today may get you stirred up, Aries. Remember that it takes two to start an argument. You play an equal part in any disagreement.

If peace and harmony aren't your ultimate goal, you may need to look inside yourself to explore the reasons why.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|18|2|There's a great deal of power to your words today, Taurus, so be careful how you use them. You may end up manipulating another's choices if you aren't careful with your conduct.

Be open and honest about all the facts that might influence their decisions in any way.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|18|3|Answers may not be crystal clear today, Gemini. They probably won't be laid out in a neat and organized manner. Get out in the open air and join friends for a long bike ride. Fly a kite or feel the wind blow through your hair on top of a mountain peak. The answer is flowing through the air around you. Stop looking down at the ground for the information you seek.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|18|4|Your head should be quite clear today, Cancer, and your witty comments will be met with appreciation and laughter. Your smile will delight everyone you encounter.

Your heart is warm and generous, so share it with other people today.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|18|5|Don't worry about probing too deeply today, Leo. Trust people more than you normally would. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you approach them from a neutral or positive and not accusatory position. Listen to the people you care about the most. They're trying to convey important information. You might not want to hear it now, but in the long run, it's in everyone's best interests that you do.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|18|6|You might consider taking a short trip today, Virgo. Perhaps you need to get out of the house and go across town. Whatever it is, introduce your brain to a new reality. It's time to expand and explore. You itch to see new places and experience new things, either physically or mentally. Perhaps a religious sanctuary or quiet place in grove of trees is what you need in order to quench this inner thirst.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|18|7|Your mind might be stimulated today, Libra, so stay alert and open to new information. If you feel tired, take a short nap. It's better to operate at top speed and full capacity than go through your day only half present. Don't rely on external stimulants like caffeine to pick you up. These things will deceive your body and do damage to your nervous system.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|18|8|Communication is flowing smoothly today, Scorpio, so take advantage of this and get the word out. It's important for you to make connections with other people now. Run with your instincts and feel free to enter into debates. Your words and tone of voice are very convincing. You could sell anything to anyone today.|Cancer|Capricorn|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|18|9|Don't let fear of failure or fear of success hold you back, Sagittarius. Even though you may feel a natural tendency to want to shrink into the background and take the easiest route, you might be sacrificing your true purpose when you do. Become the leader instead of following the leader. Rid yourself of all fear and take control of your destiny.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|18|10|Powerful thoughts are running through your brain. You will find that this information can be transforming, Capricorn. The key is to learn from others and incorporate opposing viewpoints into your state of mind. Don't automatically disregard the opinion of another just because it contradicts your own beliefs. Teamwork is the name of the game on a day like today.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|18|11|Information coming your way today might be unreliable, Aquarius. It could be hard for you to take a solid hold on the messages you get. Keep in mind that there are important answers waiting to be heard. These answers will come to you when you least expect them. Keep your mind open to new possibilities and the path will open up and become clear. Don't compromise your consciousness with abusive substances.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|18|12|Be careful about being manipulated by another person today, Pisces. It's possible that someone is putting words in your mouth in order to get you to act a certain way. Don't fall into this trap. Be your own person and think for yourself. Your mind is susceptible and vulnerable now. Use your eyes and ears as a filter and don't let people unload their garbage on you.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|19|1|You might feel like you're getting worked up from all angles today, Aries. Find comfort in knowing that things will definitely improve by tomorrow.

Try to stay abreast of information and developments around you so you can make the most informed decisions possible.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|19|2|Try to rise above the potential tension and rough spots of the day, Taurus. Do yourself a favor and don't feel like you have to stoop to another's level. Take pride in your actions and do things with confidence. Work with the negativity. The worst thing to do would be to ignore it. Approach problems squarely as soon as they arise. Don't dredge up the past. It's time to move forward.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|19|3|You might want to escape the frenzy of the day by going shopping, Gemini. Align yourself with partners and allies who share your views. Try to keep the disagreements to a minimum. There is enough tension and war raging in the world around you today that you don't need to add to the negative force by contributing disputes and ailments to the situation.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|19|4|Your mood should be quite good today, Cancer, although there may be some strong forces at work trying to subvert this positive attitude. Try not to let other people's disagreements bring you down. Take the high ground and you will certainly prevail. A peaceful nature is extremely important in order to balance the anger and hostility that's present all around. Be the one to promote this harmony.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|19|5|Today's arena is one in which you can find a great deal of material, Leo. There will be no shortage of energy to work with or opinions coming from you. Realize that your words have a greater potency about them as people become more intent on uncovering the truth. Apply yourself to peace and cooperation among groups. Help people work together toward a common goal.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|19|6|Peace and harmony are in the regularly scheduled program for the day, but there is a good chance that there could be a warring force with strong opinions and vindictive tendencies. Hold onto your hat, Virgo, and make sure you have your actions well aligned with your soul or else you could be thrown into a battle that has nothing to do with you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|19|7|I told you so might be your motto of the day. Try not to rub this in other people's faces, Libra. Indeed, you have the foresight to witness an action and see the consequences right away. These consequences might rear their ugly heads on a day like this. Use your incredible perception and intuition to hone in on the best solution possible and work toward that goal before things get out of hand.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|19|8|You may know exactly the right thing to do today, but for some reason, the action required may be a hard thing for you to implement, Scorpio. Take an active role to get involved. Say your peace, but don't get so attached to the results that you get upset and discouraged if things don't exactly work out according to plan. Independence is an important virtue to hold onto today.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|19|9|Make sure your opinion doesn't get lost in the frenzy of the day, Sagittarius. Your words may not quite fit with the things that people want to hear. Try not to take this personally. Realize that this isn't an indication that your words are any less important. You have an incredible gift of being able to see things that others can't. Cherish and nourish this ability instead of invalidating it.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|19|10|You have two choices today. Either jump into the thick of the mess with both feet or stay out of it altogether. There are definitely two distinct camps setting up their arsenals for battle. Realize that there is also a soft, tender, harmonious aspect that just wants peace. It will be hard to ignore the fact that your usual warring nature is ready to do battle.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|19|11|You may end up being the peaceful savior that calms everyone down today, Aquarius. Use your artistic nature and love of beauty and harmony to inspire others to put away their differences and concentrate on the positive aspects. Generous acceptance of others is the only way to go, especially today, when people are riled up and ready to fight. Do your best to promote peace.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|19|12|Your unique ability to communicate with many different groups and personalities will be extremely important today to maintaining a bridge between warring camps, Pisces. Keep things moving and try not to let the situation stagnate on any one issue. If the conversation turns to raging and ranting, it's in your best interests to stop it right away. Don't be afraid to step up and take a leadership role.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|20|1|You might experience a bit of an internal conflict today and be you're unsure how to proceed, Aries. One side feels an urge to fight, while another side - a more mental aspect - asks you to keep this urge under wraps. It could be that this conflict keeps you immobile because of your lack of confidence in either camp. Try not to get stressed out over any one issue.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|20|2|It may be hard to connect with others today, Taurus. People may be rather indecisive. On the other hand, people are apt to be more malleable. This could be a good time to take charge. Be sure that you keep in mind the best interests of all parties involved. It isn't fair for you to take advantage of people who can't make up their own minds about something.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|20|3|You've had a strong propensity for war lately, Gemini. Your drive toward getting things done has rallied and you're anxious to make progress. The problem is that you might have to hold back a bit today, since there is a great force at work encouraging to you to take a break from your current trajectory. Slow down and make a plan instead of just plowing blindly ahead toward the unknown.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|20|4|Your balancing powers will be put to the test today when your desire to fight conflicts with your need to plan, Cancer. You might be even more indecisive than usual as a result of this internal tension. Be aware of time and the restrictions that it puts on you. Devise a plan that uses your energy in the most efficient way possible. It's especially important for you to think before you act.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|20|5|Try not to get too frustrated by the indecisiveness that plagues you today, Leo. The longer you stand still, the harder it will be to get moving. The key is to find a balance between planning and forcefulness. There's an incredible need for you make progress now. If you're met with resistance, you should probably just back off for now. Fighting won't yield positive results now.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|20|6|Indecisiveness could be your biggest nemesis today, Virgo. The general tone of the day is apt to be quite explosive as a feeling of restriction and discipline comes into conflict with a need to fight and conquer. You might find that your go-with-the-flow, easygoing attitude is exactly what saves you on a day like this. Lay low and let someone else take the lead now.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|20|7|Your plans meet with harsh opposition today, Libra. You've been going along at a slow and steady pace, but you will find that abrasive tension arises the more you try to force your will on others. Gridlock is quite likely due to the fact that there are strong forces coming to a head. Neither one of them is in the mood to yield now.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|20|8|Getting your opinions out now may stir up the maelstrom even more, but ultimately it's for the best, Scorpio. There is an explosive tone in the air right now that's difficult to ignore. You need your strong will to combat the abrasive forces at work today. You have the opportunity to initiate control over the situation. Other people might be too unsure of themselves to make a move.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|20|9|Your best plan of attack today is to not attack at all, Sagittarius. There is enough aggressiveness out there. You don't need to add any more to the fray. Let others duke it out. Your job is to wait until the dust settles. Try not to get involved in other people's disputes. You might get dragged further into the situation than makes you feel comfortable.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|20|10|You might need to put on the brakes today, Capricorn. Your present trajectory isn't quite in line with the people and energy around you. Make sure you aren't stepping on other people's toes with your abrasive behavior. This is a day to consider a more disciplined approach. You might need to establish a better structure so you use your energy more efficiently in general.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|20|11|If you've been reluctant to make a move, Aquarius, you should consider why. What has been holding you back? Fear of failure? A negative comment from someone else? Feeling like you aren't quite prepared for the consequences of your actions? It's time to free yourself of these mental barriers that keep you from making progress. Don't let self-doubt get in the way of your plans.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|20|12|Discipline and a solid plan are your friends today, Pisces. Slow your approach and consider the consequences of your actions. This is the time to concentrate on what you need to get done and devise a plan to make it happen. There is restlessness in the air that might cause you to act hastily. Don't forget the old saying that says haste makes waste. This is an important lesson.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|1|You may feel like the world is caving in on you in many ways today, Aries. It could be that you've recently dug your own little cave to crawl into and be safe from the outside world. Realize that the deeper you dig in unstable terrain, the more unsteady the walls. If you aren't careful, it's likely to come crashing down on top of you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|21|2|Remember that you can only remain in charge as long as the others around you support your personality and leadership abilities, Taurus. Avoid mutiny by taking care of the people in your world instead of simply trying to run their lives. Gain respect with kind words and a sensitive attitude rather than by enforcing harsh rules and regulations that restrict and aggravate.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|3|There should be no doubt in your mind about which way to proceed, Gemini. Don't let self-doubt sneak into the picture. Your mind is sensitive and alert, so trust it. Take the lead when you feel confident about a situation. Make sure to eat plenty of protein-rich foods. They'll help stabilize and bring you another step closer to the realization of your dreams.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|21|4|Your rock-star attitude may be getting a bit old now, Cancer. People aren't going to continue to listen to your demands for attention. Every person in the world is special, so try not to act as if you're the only one who is. Help a child assemble a new toy today or help a friend pick out a new shirt. Do something for others instead of always expecting things for yourself.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|5|Your ship is finally coming into port after being out in rough seas for so long, Leo. It's time to dock the boat for a while. Relax and explore the area. There is nothing wrong with getting off your vessel for a while. You may not even realize how much you've missed solid ground until now. Remember what it's like to be stable again.|Aries|Libra|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|21|6|You may still be on something of a high from the last couple weeks. You will definitely be tempted to let the good times continue to roll, Virgo. Think about ways you can keep them rolling while still maintaining good judgment. Don't let things get too out of control today. It's important that you maintain a bit of stability at all times.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|7|Communicate from a centered space today, Libra. Fortunately, the nature of the day caters to your needs and desires. You shouldn't have to work too hard to get what you want. Things should come to you naturally. You may wonder why you got stressed out before over what now seem to be small issues. Consciously release the worry and concern that are still stored in your body.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|21|8|Work toward achieving a better unity between you and the people around you, Scorpio. It could be that certain people in your circle of friends somehow feel alienated in one way or another. Perhaps they don't feel like they fit in with the rest of the group. Remind yourself and others that everyone is unique and that all should be equally accepted despite individual differences.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|21|9|You will feel much better about yourself if you get things done today, Sagittarius. Like a meal that tastes good but isn't necessarily good for you, you might enjoy this day by being lazy, but you won't feel so good when night comes and you realize that you haven't accomplished anything. Use the day productively so you have a sense of fulfillment by tonight.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|21|10|You might consider taking a rest today, Capricorn. Like a sailboat on the ocean, you've been taxed lately by all the turbulence. The pressure on you has been tremendous. Think about pulling your sails to half-mast in order to take a break. You may not be going as quickly as before, but you will find that this is exactly the rest you need in order to complete the voyage.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|11|Your thinking is apt to be quite clear and rational today, Aquarius. This is especially important, since others will be looking for your thoughts and opinions on a certain matter. People will know that they can get a straight and honest answer from you, so don't disappoint them. Think through each situation clearly before you offer your advice. You will find that it's worth the effort.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|21|12|By being around negative and flip people, you might inadvertently pick up these habits. Be careful about your associates, Pisces, because you will find that others judge you according to the company you keep, especially if you start talking like them. Make sure to maintain a respectful attitude and proper manners no matter who your company is.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|22|1|Tap into the boisterous, lighthearted mood of the day instead of getting bogged down with heavy emotions, Aries. This is a good time to engage your mind rather than let your heart take control. Be aware of the expansive nature of the day that allows you to think clearly without getting bothered by emotions. Take the cerebral route to figuring out what you need to do to smooth any bumps in the road.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|22|2|Your optimism will be inspiring today, Taurus. You will find that your lighthearted approach is perfectly suited to taking care of any issue that arises. Toss a few jokes into the mix and remind other people that it isn't necessary to take things so seriously. The Sun is shining as you proudly parade down the street with your head held high.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|22|3|Difficult challenges that have been lingering on the sidelines will probably become more prominent today, Gemini. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a head. The problem was easy to overlook at first, but now that it has taken on a life of its own, you may have to consult someone who is more of an expert on these types of situations than you are.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|22|4|You could be the one everyone runs to for advice today, Cancer. You're the one with all the answers who can easily pull the rabbit out of a hat. Trust your judgment and intellectual know-how. Feel free to push yourself to the limit. If you go too far, you can always take a step back. If you never drive all the way to the boundaries, you will never know how far you can go.|Pisces|Virgo|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|22|5|You may get frustrated when you find that people aren't as sensitive to a situation as you want them to be, Leo. While you're looking to make a strong connection with someone, almost wanting to take possession of his or her feelings, that person, in turn, is trying to pull back. People are apt to gravitate toward rational facts rather than intense, smothering emotions.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|22|6|A small spark in a dry field is apt to whip the hill into flames, Virgo. A raging wildfire may be underway by the end of the day. Know that you're one of the biggest perpetrators, but don't feel badly about it. Fire is destructive but also necessary. Clearing out brush and offering a fresh new place in which new growth can flourish is an important part of the cycle of nature.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|22|7|Put on some lively music you can dance to and really kick up your heels, Libra. It's time to put away the sour mood and have fun with a large group of people. You will find that the more you engage in intellectual discussions, the more you will get warmed up to the idea that life should be fun, not the pain and stress you sometimes make it out to be.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|22|8|This is a tremendously expansive time for you, Scorpio, and there is very little that will stop your momentum once you get going. Your eyes are alive with a spark that says that you're ready to take on the world. Believe this about yourself and others will believe in you. There is a great deal of luck on your side today, so take a gamble in a certain part of your life.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|22|9|This is a good time to put things in writing, Sagittarius. Your gift with words is apt to shine today as you write a proposal, email, or love poem. You're able to communicate very well when you put your sensitive emotions aside and concentrate on what you think instead of what you feel. Expand your influence by focusing on those things that require a more cerebral approach.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|22|10|The day's energy is apt to be lively, making it much easier to get the things done that you need to do, Capricorn. You will find people are more than eager to help you. The trick is to integrate your leadership abilities with the knowledge available from other people. You will create a winning combination of power and strength to put to use in just about any realm of your life.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|22|11|Obstacles that you have ignored are suddenly starting to expand beyond reasonable proportions, Aquarius. Be careful of what you say as a result, because your words could spread like wildfire. This is no laughing matter. Difficulties in your world are likely to crop up, and you will find your ego threatened. Try to keep some sort of emotional barrier.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|22|12|This is a terrific day for you, Pisces, and you will glow brightly from head to toe as you radiate your true inner self to the world. You will find profound joy in the simplest, most ordinary circumstances. If you run out of things to say, feel free to whistle a tune. This isn't likely to happen today, since you will overflow with things to talk about.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|23|1|A minor and rather silly quarrel with a friend or romantic partner could have you down in the dumps. This is an overreaction, Aries. You might need to get away for a while before you can make sense of it all. Too many demands from others could have you feeling used, and you might be tempted to tell them off. Try to avoid others long enough to gain control of yourself.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|23|2|Pressures on the job may be mounting. You might feel so disgruntled that you want to chuck it all and run away. Foreign countries and distant states may suddenly seem far more appealing than usual. Maybe it's a good idea to plan a vacation, Taurus. The stresses you've been experiencing could adversely affect your health. You need to release them somehow. Give it some thought.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|23|3|Demands made by friends, children, or the special person in your life might have you feeling like you're moving in a dozen different directions at once. You may feel unfocused and scattered. You usually enjoy serving others, Gemini, but today you need to concentrate a little more on yourself. Show others how to help themselves and then go and do something you want to do. You deserve it!|Aquarius|Leo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|23|4|A number of visitors, deliveries, service people, emails, or phone calls might keep you jumping today, Cancer, right when you're in the mood for a quiet day. It may take all your effort to keep your cool. Try to get a family member to intercede for you with some of these people or you might lose your temper. In the evening, go to a movie and relax.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|23|5|A close friend might pass along some seemingly harmless but nonetheless untrue gossip, Leo. Don't accept anything you hear today until you check the facts for yourself. Any information you receive is likely to be exaggerated if not totally false. You might find a lot of material on subjects that interest you - too much for you to read all at once, although you might wish you could!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|23|6|You don't normally tend toward frugality, Virgo, but today you could go overboard with your spending. Frustration from all sides makes you want to release it all at once by acquiring new possessions. This is fine up to a point. Treat yourself, but take care that you curb the impulse buying. You don't want to waste any time tomorrow taking unwanted items back to the store.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|23|7|Some failures that you may have experienced over the past few days could have you beating yourself up today, Libra. Perhaps you feel that you were too hasty or too sloppy and could have done things better. Don't obsess over it. Figure out what went wrong, learn from it, and let it go. Too much negativity directed at yourself is likely to sabotage future efforts rather than help them.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|23|8|Today you might be able to tune in to the thoughts and feelings of others, Scorpio, but you aren't likely to know exactly how to handle the situation. Should you say something or just tailor your own behavior to suit the moods of others? Reflect on the situation before doing either. This is a great day to meditate or read books or attend lectures on spiritual matters.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|23|9|Group activities are probably very much on your agenda today, Sagittarius. You could go to a meeting or lecture and later go out on the town with a group of friends. Don't be tempted to eat or drink too much. You'll likely regret it tomorrow. An unexpected sum of extra money could come your way. Don't spend it all in one place. This is a great day to concentrate on having fun - within limits.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|23|10|Too much pressure on the job could have you feeling like chucking it all and going somewhere by yourself. You might be tempted to go on a spending spree or overindulge in food or drink. This may spill over into your personal relationships, causing disagreements with friends or family. It might be a good idea to be alone for a few hours, Capricorn. You will feel much better once you clear your head.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|23|11|Inner conflict regarding spiritual matters might have you questioning your and others' beliefs. You might doubt just about everything, Aquarius, and you could be tempted into angry debates over different concepts. Books or TV documentaries on whatever is bothering you might spark your curiosity and calm you down a little. A legal matter might come to the forefront today. It's a hassle, but it needs to be handled.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|23|12|Although your financial situation appears to be on the upswing, you still might be feeling pessimistic and indifferent about money and life in general. You might want to soothe your discontent by overspending, overindulging in food or drink, or both. Don't let this feeling get the better of you, Pisces. Get together with some friends and have a good time. Treat yourself to a little something without going over the top!|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|1|Are you spending a lot of time working on something you've been trying to learn well? It could be more confusing than usual today, Aries. You might come across a new concept that doesn't quite make sense to you at first glance. Don't waste time puzzling over it. Think about something else. The meaning of it all should come to you out of the blue. Be patient.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|2|Did you wake up this morning with a vague recollection of a half-remembered dream bugging you? If so, it won't do any good to try to pull it up. Perhaps you aren't meant to remember the entire thing, in which case you should try analyzing the little bit you do remember. Perhaps it will come to you when something reminds you later. Don't let it drive you crazy. It's only a dream, after all.|Capricorn|Cancer|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|24|3|Legal matters may be on your mind today, Gemini. Maybe your insecurities are blowing a certain difficulty all out of proportion. You need to view the entire situation a little more objectively. If you can find someone in the know, ask him or her to fill you in on the facts. You will be relieved to know you've been making mountains out of molehills. For now, try to relax and lighten up a little.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|4|You may need someone's help or advice today, Cancer. Don't be afraid to ask for it. You tend to be proud of your ingenuity and independence. Most of the time others are the ones reaching out to you. You do have the right to ask for help. It isn't a sign of weakness. Knowing when to ask for help is a strength. Think about it.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|24|5|Is your significant other uncertain about spending much time with you today, Leo? You may be hurt at first, as your honey could feel obligated to spend some private time with family members. You should be able to get together as you hoped. Just don't expect it to be for the whole day. Spend your alone time relaxing and sprucing yourself up.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|24|6|Are you entertaining tonight, Virgo? If so, you might be a little worried about what your guests think of your home and your skills as a host. Don't waste any time worrying. A good time will be had by all, including you. Everyone is likely to have a memorable evening. Just do your best, be your usual jovial self, and concentrate on having fun.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|24|7|A special gathering may take place in your neighborhood today, Libra. If you're currently involved, you will probably attend it with your significant other. If you aren't seeing anyone, you will run into some old friends and possibly make some new ones. One of them could be a potential love interest, perhaps a little older than you. Relax, let loose, and have a little fun.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|8|Social occasions of all kinds could take place today, Scorpio. Some older visitors, perhaps your parents, could visit your home. It may be a rather quiet visit, with conversation that's more casual than intense, but it will be nice nonetheless. Later you could go out with friends or colleagues or meet them at a celebration of some sort.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|9|Someone you've been expecting to call might not do so today, Sagittarius, and this could worry you a little. Don't be too shy to pick up the phone and call. Your friend may have overslept or been too overwhelmed by work or visitors. You haven't been forgotten. If you phone, this person will undoubtedly be glad to hear from you. After the conversation, go for a walk in your neighborhood.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|24|10|"Worries about money could be on your mind today, Capricorn. A check you've been expecting may not have arrived. Perhaps a project you've taken on is taking longer to complete than you thought, and so expected funds are delayed. The key word to remember here is ""delayed."" It's late, not cancelled altogether. Be patient and don't waste any more time worrying!"|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|24|11|The desire to get together with friends is strong today, Aquarius, but you might be unable to do it as early as you'd hoped. You could be delayed by leftover work or chores. Don't despair, however. You will get out and have fun as planned. Pitch into whatever needs to be done and get it out of the way. You might be able to get to your gathering on time after all.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|24|12|A career goal you've been hoping to reach may seem uncertain now, Pisces. You could be wondering if your work has gone for naught. Don't think this way. There's a lot going on behind the scenes that you aren't aware of yet. When you hear about these developments, you will know that you're still in the running. Don't waste your whole day thinking about work. Try to relax. Tomorrow it may all come together.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|25|1|Technology could pave the way for you to greatly increase your income, possibly through new skills or investments. This is likely to be a very positive development, setting the stage for future financial success. Some unusual, interesting dreams could come your way, bringing unexpected revelations about you and your past - and possibly your future. Write them down! They could hold important messages for you from your higher self.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|25|2|The unexpected need to take a journey by air or spend a lot of time working could bring about an inconvenient separation from your partner. While the reasons for this situation and the projected outcome are very positive, it can cause a temporary upset in your relationship. Don't worry about it. The upset will pass, particularly when the desired results are attained. Concentrate on the matter at hand.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|25|3|Is your workplace upgrading its equipment? Are you in the process of increasing your technology skills? Today's planets show that success and advancement through technology are definitely in the offing for you, Gemini. If you've been thinking about purchasing a computer, do it today if you can. Whatever your goals, you can harness current innovations to help them along. Give it some thought!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|25|4|Some close friends could turn you on to a new interest or perhaps a group you might want to join. Intellectual stimulation through those closest to you could open the way to new plans and innovations. You might want to try combining artistic interests with technology, Cancer, perhaps expanding your knowledge of photography, computer graphics, or filmmaking. Success and good fortune through such activities are strongly indicated.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|25|5|Sudden, unexpected visitors could arrive today, perhaps by air or in a new car. You could host a group meeting of some kind at your house. A lot of exciting information and stimulating conversation could take place, Leo, bringing fresh ideas that spark new interests. Expect a very busy but productive day, looking ahead toward the future rather than back toward the past.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|25|6|Short journeys in your neighborhood, perhaps connected with a group you're associated with, could take up a lot of your time today, Virgo. Fascinating and stimulating emails or calls could arrive. Books and magazine articles could provide information that sends you in a new direction in some way. Write down your ideas! You will want to remember them all.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|25|7|Unexpected money developments could brighten your day today, Libra. Perhaps you will get a raise or an increase in some other form of income. Technology could be involved in some way, or a long-term goal you've been striving for finally brings in some benefits. There might be uncertainty about when it's coming or exactly how much it will be, but the outcome will be gratifying all the same!|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|25|8|A surprising revelation, either from within or from sources like books, the Internet, or communications from others could set you in an entirely new direction. You will have an increased sense of freedom, as well as a clearer and more progressive outlook. You might consider some pretty heavy changes in your life, Scorpio, but don't make any final decisions or arrangements today. Wait before putting your ideas into action.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|25|9|Discoveries made through occult sciences such as astrology or numerology could see you embrace some rather revolutionary ideas about yourself, the world, and life. You could become involved with a group associated with metaphysical studies or take a class or workshop of some kind. This could mean a new direction for you in some way, Sagittarius. It might greatly enhance your life and thinking.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|25|10|Sudden lucky breaks could come your way today, Capricorn, possibly through friends or groups with which you're involved. A long-term goal you've been working toward might bring unexpected but wonderful results. Group activities, particularly those involving social or political issues, could take up a lot of your time. This promises to be a busy, productive day. Expect the unexpected!|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|25|11|Today you might feel the desire to break free from your daily routine, Aquarius, particularly regarding career matters. You might consider developing a business of your own, one that would give you a lot more freedom than you currently have. This is a good day to start looking into it. You might find that there are more possibilities out there than you expected.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|25|12|A sudden and unexpected opportunity to take a journey by air could come your way today, Pisces. This might be something you've wanted for a long time finally manifesting. Certainly adventure is in the air, although it might be mental adventure as much as physical. Some information could come your way that catapults you into a new and exciting field of interest. This promises to be a thoroughly stimulating day.|Scorpio|Taurus|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|26|1|Today you might feel too overwrought to concentrate on whatever goals you're trying to reach, particularly if they're financial. Past issues might crop up at inopportune times but will still need to be released. If you aren't careful, this could get in the way of just about anything you need to do. Keeping cool is the most important thing to remember.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|26|2|You tend to be pretty self-assured, Taurus, but self-esteem issues dating from long ago could surface today. You might feel like a schoolchild called on to recite. This could cause a few snags in your relationships or interfere with your effectiveness at social occasions. Try to remain objective. Don't lose sight of who you are. Don't let old insecurity interfere with your effectiveness.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|26|3|Today you might feel a bit bloated and slow, Gemini, which could interfere with your daily routine. You could also feel unmotivated about work. You might not feel like exercising, but it's important that you do it anyway. Moving the body can clear your head and put you in the proper frame of mind to get on with your day. It can also help purge your tissues of all the excess toxins.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|26|4|Today your job or another activity could require your artistic skills for a particular project, Cancer. You may not be used to this, so it could throw you into a bit of a panic. There should be others around who can collaborate with you, so you will be all right. A tendency to be overly emotional could interfere with just about anything you try. Stay centered.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|26|5|A subject of interest that you've been pursuing could bring up some deeply buried emotions today, Leo. You might want to retreat into your mind and try to make sense of it, although analyzing it intellectually may not be the answer. Avoid emotional confrontations. Things might be said that shouldn't be said, and they won't be easily forgotten. In the evening, see a movie full of special effects.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|26|6|This could be a confusing day for you, Virgo. Financial issues might be complicated by computer glitches or failures in communication. Keep pushing, however, and whatever you're trying to straighten out will be resolved. An opportunity to participate in a project you've never tried before could have you doubting your abilities. Believe in yourself and then move ahead. There's a first time for everything!|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|26|7|Financial issues might have you and your partner a bit more on edge than you need to be, Libra. Perhaps money is tighter than usual right now, and you have to put off purchases you want to make. Try to work it out. This is a great day to reach a compromise in just about any touchy situation, because you should be in just the right space to see both sides of any issue.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|26|8|Today your intellect is flying high, Scorpio. A number of new ideas, perhaps about political or social issues, might excite your curiosity and cause you to want to spend hours in the library or on the Internet. Mundane tasks still need handling, however. This might be frustrating, because it takes you away from your quest. If you get the basics done quickly, you can return without causing any undue guilt.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|26|9|Your imagination is working overtime today, Sagittarius, and you might spend hours at a computer writing or in front of an easel or piano creating your own brand of painting or music. This drive to create comes from the heart and shouldn't be ignored no matter what other issues come up. Take care of whatever needs to be handled and then follow your inspiration. You may be surprised at what you produce!|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|26|10|A conflict between your responsibilities to family and obligations to friends could rear its ugly head today, Capricorn. You might want to attend an event but need to deal with emotional issues in the home immediately. It could be difficult to keep a cool head under these circumstances. If you can, you should find a way to satisfy your family and go out. Step back and be objective!|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|26|11|Dissatisfaction with certain job conditions might come to a head today, Aquarius. A discussion with colleagues might be necessary to defuse a potentially explosive situation. Clear, honest communication is necessary in order to avoid misunderstandings. Try to remain objective. Don't let your emotions take control. Things will work out to everyone's satisfaction. The situation is temporary and unlikely to have lasting negative effects.|Libra|Aries|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|26|12|If you've been planning a long trip by air, Pisces, today you might doubt whether you should continue with your plans. Money might be the issue. Be aware that your fears may run away with you. The situation may be more secure than it appears. You might want to attend a class or lecture, perhaps on computer science or some other technology. As with the vacation plans, try to view this objectively.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|27|1|Computer glitches or bank errors might send erroneous information to you about your finances. Perhaps the bank says you have less money than you do or a bill is higher than you thought it should be. If you can, make sure it gets settled today. You won't want to spend your day under this cloud. You will probably want to indulge in total frivolity. Go ahead, Aries, you deserve it!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|27|2|You and someone close could disagree on an issue that both of you feel strongly about. Stubborn pride on both your parts could keep you from working things out. Let it go, Taurus. It isn't worth ruining your relationship. Someone you know might be headed for divorce or moving away, and the news could be a shock to you. This should be a day of surprises - not all of them pleasant.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|27|3|Problems with machines could have your nerves on edge. This may be one day when everything seems to break. Some problems you might be able to fix yourself, Gemini, but at least one may involve something that has to be replaced. This might be the one you need the most right now. Think of it as a sign from the Universe that you should do something else. That's the only way to stay sane.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|27|4|Today you might attend a party or group event with some friends, and become separated from them. Don't panic, Cancer. You will probably run into them later. You might meet some new friends and hear some news that could interest you. This is a day when cell phones and other handheld devices are likely to come in handy. You will want to record or pass on a lot of information.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|27|5|A number of surprise visitors could result in an impromptu party of some sort. This could be fun for you, Leo, but it could also be a bit irritating. It might interfere with something you had planned. There's nothing you can do without sounding like Scrooge. Go with the flow, enjoy yourself, and then try to salvage your own plans as best as you can.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|27|6|This isn't the day to take a trip by air, Virgo. Everything that can go wrong with such a trip will - delays, lost luggage, obnoxious seatmates. If you have one planned for today, change it to tomorrow. This also isn't a good day to take a class, since your attention span could be unusually short. What can you do? Relax, read, surf the Internet. A lot of interesting information could spark your curiosity.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|27|7|One of your ambitions in life is to be financially independent, and lately you might have made great strides toward attaining that goal. Today, through no fault of your own, you may receive information that indicates there may have been a setback. However, all is not as it seems. Don't go into a panic until you know all the facts, Libra. You're probably still right on track.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|27|8|A surprising revelation from a friend or acquaintance might wake you up to the fact that you don't really know this person as well as you thought you did. Information could set you off on a search for knowledge that keeps you occupied for hours. A child or young person could come to you and ask for help. This promises to be a busy but interesting day, Scorpio. Make the most of it!|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|27|9|Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour today, Sagittarius. Thoughts and ideas are pouring into your head like rain from the sky. Some of them might be confusing and others contradictory. You might be tempted to puzzle over them until you give yourself a headache. Write them down and look at them in a day or two. Your ideas are more likely to make sense to you then.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|27|10|An old friend you haven't seen for a long time may suddenly resurface, perhaps at a party or group event that you attend. This could take you by surprise, Capricorn, but you won't be any less happy to see him or her again. Surprising news may come to you through email or phone, and this might set you off in a totally different direction from the one you started in this morning.|Virgo|Pisces|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|27|11|A sudden, unexpected problem at home could be rather upsetting. This probably relates to plumbing, electricity, or some other kind of home equipment. You will have to handle it, Aquarius, which means you will be housebound for most of the day waiting for a repairman when you'd rather be out. A friend might hear of your predicament and come over to keep you company.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|27|12|Upsetting news that you receive from far away, perhaps by phone or email, could send you into an emotional tailspin. There's an aura of uncertainty about what you hear - it may not make sense. Before you pass along the news or panic, Pisces, make sure you know all the facts. You're likely to find that it's been blown all out of proportion. In view of this, you deserve an evening out.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|28|1|Social events and group activities are on the agenda today, Aries. You may be introduced to someone who could prove helpful to your career. A letter containing good news could come from a friend or partner. Any new moneymaking enterprise begun now is likely to succeed as long as you stay with it and continue to face it in a businesslike manner.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|10|28|2|Glowing health and an enthusiastic attitude make almost anything a pleasure today, Taurus. Relations with friends and family are warm, congenial, and cooperative. Your day should go as smoothly as you could expect. There is something you want to do in the afternoon that you're looking forward to. In the evening, consider attending a class, lecture, or workshop. Your mind is especially sharp right now.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|28|3|Information that comes your way today could launch you into a search for truth, Gemini. Perhaps this is a new business-related idea that you want to explore. It could be a new philosophical interest, and you will want to learn as much as you can about it. Whichever it is, your mind is sharp, so you're likely to finish the day a lot more knowledgeable than you were when it began.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|28|4|Although you're usually very responsible and you try to keep the proper balance between your home and professional lives, today your mind and heart are more focused on your home, Cancer. A warm sense of unity with family and close friends could make for a very pleasant day and an even more pleasant evening. Even finishing up paperwork will seem easier than usual. Relax and enjoy a great evening.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|28|5|A gathering in your community could unite the people around you in aiming for a common goal, and this could be a new interest for you, Leo. Warm and loving emails and calls could come from family, close friends, or your life partner. An impromptu short trip to a favorite place could result in a pleasant surprise. This promises to be a busy day and a great one.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|28|6|You may have been expecting some money over the past several days, and today it could finally arrive. Delays in reaching your goals are finished for the moment. If you have a project you've been trying to complete, Virgo, this is the day to do it, especially if it involves paperwork. This isn't the day to compete with anyone, however. Your sense of cooperation is too strong.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|28|7|You're feeling especially sharp, Libra. Your thoughts are more focused than usual and your mind especially penetrating. A promised get-together with friends or loved ones may have to be delayed, but it will take place. Information about possible business opportunities could come through periodicals, and if you like them, check them out. The outlook on anything that comes your way today is especially bright.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|28|8|Practical thoughts may be the result of unconscious impulses brought to the surface by events at home. Old traumas and phobias could be released, although you should take care to not dwell on them too much or you'll reinforce them instead of get rid of them. Your imagination is flying high. You might focus it on decorating your house. You could find antiques especially appealing.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|28|9|Gatherings in your neighborhood could bring new and interesting information your way, Sagittarius. A message from an acquaintance could send you down a new path toward a new goal. Relations with everyone around you - from your romantic partner to the most casual of acquaintances - should be warm and congenial. Conversations should be stimulating.|Leo|Aquarius|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|28|10|Success in a project you've been working on could mean you want to go out and celebrate. You might feel guilty about doing it, but go ahead, Capricorn. Order a glass of wine and dessert! Tonight is the night to forget work and go for sheer, unadulterated pleasure. You have the break coming. Your efforts are finally being recognized, and you're on your way. Enjoy your good fortune!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|28|11|A subject that you've been studying for a long time might suddenly start making sense to you, Aquarius. Or you could finally reach a point where you can make it work for you in a practical way. Your thinking now is especially clear, focused, down to Earth, and efficient, so whatever you try or start today is likely to lead to success. Don't let occasional self-doubt stop you.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|28|12|Past impressions that you may not even know you have could enhance your ability to deal with practical matters today, Pisces. You might need to handle some paperwork regarding a settlement of some kind. The thoughts and feelings of those closest to you are more apparent than usual. You may tailor your behavior toward them accordingly. Spend a quiet evening with your loved ones. You won't even need to talk.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|29|1|Relatives or neighbors may come to you today asking for favors. Some may know exactly what buttons to push in order to get you to do what they want. Don't be sucked into guilt or other negative emotions. Help others if you wish, Aries, but recognize that you're doing it because you want to and not because you feel you have to. You might even learn something about yourself in the process.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|29|2|A temporary lack of belief in your abilities might have you hesitating to start a project or take on a task that you'd normally snap up. This could involve something you've wanted to try or helping someone else. Your faith in yourself should never flag, but if it does, it's important to remember that hard work can be as important as talent - and you aren't afraid of that!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|29|3|A phone conversation with someone who lives far away might have you feeling a bit sad, reflecting on how much you miss that person. This can lead to pondering about your life. You might question the direction you seem to be moving in, and consider other possible options. You're likely to be cautious when it comes to making final decisions, Gemini. You will consider every detail.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|29|4|Today you might be in a reflective and meditative mood. You may think about mundane matters, such as how to increase your income, or more complex issues, such as the purpose of life. You aren't likely to want to do much socializing today, Cancer. It's probably the perfect day to stay in, relax, and enjoy your own company. Reading could prove especially informative now.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|29|5|Obligations to friends and groups could interfere with time that you want to spend with your partner. A number of visitors in your home might demand more of your time, energy, and attention, and you might find this disconcerting. You're no one's servant, Leo. You're entitled to enjoy yourself. Save some time for your mate at the end of the day.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|29|6|You might wake up this morning and decide your home is a total wreck. The desire to spend the day cleaning and sprucing up your house might prove almost obsessive. Do what you have to do, but don't get so caught up that you forget about the big picture. Whatever you do today, Virgo, view it in its proper perspective. The world won't end if your house isn't flawlessly clean.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|29|7|Extra time and attention that you have been devoting to your career should pay off about now. You've worked hard to be where you are, and you aren't through climbing the ladder of success just yet. You aren't likely to rest on your laurels. Today you might spend a lot of time planning your next goal. A little ingenuity will definitely pay off here, Libra. Use whatever advantages you have.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|29|8|An older male visitor could come to your home, possibly to help you with some work that needs to be done. Family members may have abandoned you for the day to go out and do their own thing. You will welcome the company as well as the help. Practical matters, such as the household budget, might need attention, so set aside some time to work out the details.|Cancer|Capricorn|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|29|9|Today you might perform some service to people who live in your neighborhood. Perhaps you will chauffeur people around to do their shopping. Perhaps you will help people with household tasks. Pets may also need some attention. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it, and be appreciated as well. Expect to have a very busy day. You will certainly sleep soundly tonight.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|29|10|Meticulous and sincere effort on your part may have led to a recent increase in income. Today you might be thinking of reworking your budget. While others might throw caution to the wind at a time like this, today you might go too far in the opposite direction. Be careful and realistic, Capricorn, but don't be overly frugal. You've worked hard to get where you are and you deserve a reward.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|29|11|A sense of duty toward family members, children, and your sweetheart may cause you to take on responsibilities today that you wouldn't normally assume. Sincere efforts on behalf of those you care about are likely to bring the results you want. It won't just make you happy but will also please those you are helping. This not only makes you feel appreciated, it will also boost your physical strength.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|29|12|Emotions stemming from past experiences might cause you to assume undue responsibilities, particularly concerning family members. This is fine as long as you realize what you're doing is as much for you as for the other person. Whatever tasks you assume may allow you to release old traumas and give form to your plans and ambitions. And don't be surprised if those you help today go to bat for you later.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|30|1|Have you and a friend been discussing the possibility of going into business together? If so, Aries, the two of you might want to have some serious discussions now about the nature of the business, how it should be structured, and what the financial arrangements may be. You're both sharp enough to see both the promise and the downside of your enterprise. Get some paper and pens and go to it!|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|10|30|2|Has a certain project been a drag for you lately, Taurus? Don't be surprised if today you get your second wind. You're looking at your tasks in a practical manner, your interest in them is up, and you're able to accomplish them quickly and efficiently with minimal stress. Relationships should also be going well. Make the most of this while you can!|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|30|3|Today you could complete a creative project that you've been working on for a while, Gemini. You will be more than happy with the results and inspired to move on to bigger and better things. You will feel strong enough to take on just about any type of project. It's possible that you might get started on the next one right away. Don't wear yourself out!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|30|4|Things seem to be returning to normal after the hectic pace of late, Cancer. Life has slowed down, and the energy is lower but more peaceful. There's also no rush to get anything done. The deadlines can be postponed to another day. You might take whatever spare time you have to just lie back and enjoy the quiet. Don't feel guilty. You can work hard again tomorrow!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|30|5|Have you been waiting for a letter or call from a business or romantic partner for a long time, Leo? If so, you will probably receive it today. Don't be surprised if it's long! News and useful information could be exchanged. You will feel energized and determined once the communication is completed. The partnership's future goals will be more strictly defined as a result.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|30|6|Your time finally seems to be your own, Virgo. There are probably no rush jobs to finish, no urgent phone calls to make, and no one looking over your shoulder. This causes a significant release of stress, and you're better able than usual to focus on what you have in front of you. In the evening, relax at home, order delivery, and watch a movie.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|30|7|A love relationship seems more stable than usual today, Libra. The security wraps itself around you like a blanket as you consider the events leading up to this new sense of commitment. You and your partner may spend the evening doing nothing more than being together, which feels great! Mark this day in your memory so you can recall it whenever your insecurities get the better of you.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|30|8|Today you may not feel much like working, and you might even decide to play hooky from your responsibilities, Scorpio. If you have nothing urgent to do, consider indulging this whim. Relax with a good book and a cup of tea. Watch a favorite movie. Take a long walk in a beautiful park. In the evening, cuddle with a love partner. Savor the day's gentle energy.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|30|9|A community issue may come up today concerning you and your neighbors, Sagittarius. Perhaps a meeting will be held in your home. Something requires change in your neighborhood, and most of you are probably firmly united behind it. This bodes well for your future, so you will probably feel good about the entire situation after the gathering breaks up. Onward and upward!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|30|10|A new opportunity could come your way today, Capricorn. There's no promise or guarantee, but there is an indication that if you devote yourself thoroughly, your chances of progress are pretty good over the next month for any activity that you begin today. Keep up the good work and keep smiling! The latter action is as important as the former.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|30|11|Have you wanted to take a certain course or workshop, Aquarius? If so, this is a good day to consider all the details, make some phone calls, or enroll. As far as your educational goals go, you're very focused. You're apt to stick with any program you decide to tackle. You're also apt to learn more quickly and retain more. Think about it, read the pertinent literature, then make some calls!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|30|12|Decisions regarding investments, savings, or other financial matters might need attention today, Pisces. Don't panic. You're in the right frame of mind for this. Your business sense is at an all-time high, as is your ability to focus on the task at hand. Intuition plays a strong role. Even if you don't feel like it, it's important to get this done. Tomorrow you might not be quite as focused as you are today.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|31|1|Magical events may occur today in the most unlikely places, Aries. Perhaps you're expecting to see someone in a certain environment. Even if you don't see him or her there, you will end up meeting at a special event in an entirely different place. Let your goal be your main focus. Let the details of the journey fall into place however they will.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|31|2|If you find that you aren't necessarily thinking like the rest of the group, don't panic, Taurus. In fact, this is probably a good thing. By going along with the crowd, you may be expected to act a certain way in some situations. Pretty soon you're living like a marionette strung up to a couple of sticks and manipulated by an unknown hand. Think for yourself.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|31|3|Your words may fall sharply on someone's ears today, so be aware of the impact you can have, Gemini. However, this doesn't mean that you need to dilute your message with lies in order to avoid the true topic of conversation. Just be conscious of the fact that a strong emotional response is apt to result when you open up to the truth and tell it like it is.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|10|31|4|Be careful of being hypocritical, Cancer. You may not want to disappoint people you meet, so you end up stretching the truth to suit what they want to hear. You may catch yourself a minute later telling someone else the opposite in order to protect his or her estimation of you. Figure out who you are and stick to it. If other people don't like you, that's their problem not yours.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|31|5|You may find that someone approaches you with harsh words that are apt to have a significant impact on your state of mind. You could even find that you're paralyzed in the sense that you begin to question your current actions or ones you plan to take in the future. Spend some time alone in order to sort things out before you go ahead and make any drastic life-changing moves.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|10|31|6|You may have to make an important decision today, Virgo. It has come to the point where someone draws a line in the sand and challenges you to cross it. Do you stay where you are and continue on without that person, or do you join them and support their goals and actions? The conflict today is between your head and your gut. Don't limit your choices to two. There are always compromises.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|10|31|7|As you take another step upward today, Libra, you may realize that there's a large part of the mountain you hadn't accounted for before. Perhaps this steep portion of the climb wasn't visible from below when you started the trip. Don't panic. By overreacting to the unknown, you may lose your balance and go sliding down the face of the mountain. Collect yourself, rest, and plan your strategy one step at a time.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|31|8|Try not to overanalyze your actions, Scorpio. If you continue to pick apart every aspect, you will end up getting nowhere. This principle applies to your emotions, too. Be sure that you aren't trying to make rational sense out of every feeling that comes your way. Feelings are there for you to experience. Allow them to flow through your heart and not necessarily your head.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|31|9|Your actions may go against your rational thinking, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, Sagittarius. Thoughts and feelings are apt to aggressively clash today, but that doesn't mean you have to be a victim of the resulting demolition. Note the big pieces that survive after the initial impact. Recognize these as your strengths and work to build them back up while leaving the smaller pieces behind.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|10|31|10|You may have the perfect plan all laid out, Capricorn. You've communicated to the right people, you've traveled to the appropriate spots to gather data, and you have all your resources in line. For some reason, however, every time you start to implement this plan, you run into emotional difficulties that seem too challenging to surmount. Don't let this block you from your dreams.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|10|31|11|What you think may happen today is apt to be the opposite of what actually happens, Aquarius. It could be that you have a strong mental picture of how things should proceed, but end up taking a completely different action. Try to engage every part of your body, mind, and spirit so that all are on the same page regardless of what activity you actually do.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|10|31|12|Emotions may cloud your thoughts as things start to heat up in a heavy way, Pisces. In an effort to keep things light and energetic, you may be missing the core of the situation. Don't glance too quickly over all the issues. The answer to the riddle is right there in front of you. Stop for a minute to catch your breath and you will find the solutions that you seek.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|1|1|There might be some unexpected communication coming from a long-lost friend or old roommate today, Aries. You never know whom you might run into when you leave the house, so stay alert. An old teacher could be just around the corner. Perhaps a bizarre news story in the paper catches your attention, because there on the page is a photo of the kid who lived next door to your childhood home.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|1|2|This is one of those days when you just can't wait for someone to stop talking so you can say something, Taurus. It's likely you won't even wait. Don't be surprised if friction results from such strongly held opposing views. People could blow things out of proportion, since everyone is convinced that they are right. The interesting thing about this situation is that it could result in a productive time.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|1|3|Your mind could be going in many directions, Gemini. Direct your energy toward small projects that require intellect. Your energy is likely to come in waves, so use it wisely when you have it, and feel free to take a break when you don't. Tell your boss that you will be much more productive if you have a 20-minute break in the afternoon in order to recharge.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|1|4|People will listen to you much more than usual, Cancer. Sometimes when you say something, people hear you but minutes later forget what you said. Today is different. Your words will penetrate more deeply and end up being disseminated much more widely than ever before. Don't be stingy with what you have to say. Give people your full opinion on the situation. Your impact will be significant.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|1|5|You're apt to disagree sharply with information you receive, Leo. Perhaps your attitude is a bit selfish, so you aren't able to appreciate ideas that are more humanitarian in nature. Expand your way of thinking to include the people around you. You will find that the more you offer yourself to others, the more respected and happy you will be overall.|Aries|Libra|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|1|6|Climactic events are apt to occur in your life, Virgo. It's time to condense and solidify your grand schemes and bright ideas in such a way that makes them more practical. Things may be spinning so quickly that you aren't quite sure where to jump on. Worry about that later. For now, what you need to do is express your ideas forcefully and succinctly. Doors will open as a result.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|1|7|It's time to take your communication to the next level, Libra. Expand outward and upward. For the last three weeks you've gone through a serious mental process that has helped you define what you stand for and believe in. Now you're in a phase that urges you to put these ideas into motion. The expansive quality of the day is profound, so take advantage of it and get moving.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|1|8|A new cycle is beginning for you in which you may find yourself throwing away old beliefs and mental processes, Scorpio. Out with the old and in with the new. This time of housecleaning is extremely important, for you will find that the same tired old speech that you've been working on is suddenly defunct. Pull your resources together and construct a new platform that makes you proud.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|1|9|You may feel like you're on a cliff with your legs dangling over the edge, Sagittarius. You're searching for handholds while your feet struggle to support you on a tiny ledge. You may be swearing that when you get out of this predicament, you will never come this way again. Take heart. This is all part of the cycle. These necessary challenges only make you stronger and more appreciative of the easy stretches.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|1|10|Someone has suddenly put the fan on high, Capricorn, and papers are blowing everywhere. Neat piles whisked into large swirls of chaos. Everyone is shouting opinions about what should be done about it. Meanwhile, there are people making demands on you that you just can't handle. Slow down and communicate your situation to others. They will understand and support your predicament. The wind will die down soon.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|1|11|Try not to get tangled in other people's words, Aquarius. It could be that you're accidentally misconstruing their statements because you aren't listening closely. Rather, your mind is focused on your own thoughts, even though you snap to attention when something hits you wrong. Show respect by turning down the volume in your head when someone else has the floor, even if you don't agree with what they're saying.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|1|12|There's a terrific expansive feeling to the day, Pisces, which you will appreciate more than anyone. For other people, this energy might expand into a headache. For you, it's apt to expand your feeling of success. It also might expand your stomach, so be careful that you don't overindulge. Other than that, don't hold back on your activities. Whatever you do will be very productive.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|2|1|When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly today. You may be so emotional that you can't function, Aries. That's love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you don't want to make a move without your partner's input. If you don't have a romantic partner now, find one soon, but not today.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|2|2|Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Taurus. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesn't mean you're suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If you're still asking the question without getting any positive responses, don't worry. Keep trying.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|2|3|Powerful issues arise in your life that make it difficult to find peace, Gemini. Perhaps your first tendency is to confide in your partner. More than likely, this person is contributing to the difficulties you're now having. Your best bet is to spend some time alone. If you're already alone, so much the better. Cherish this time instead of letting it make you mad.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|2|4|You may be trying to get to the end of the road too quickly without really enjoying all the steps along the way, Cancer. This is especially true when it comes to any sort of artistic project or romantic partnership that you might be involved in at this time. If you aren't savoring every part of your journey, then perhaps this isn't the path you should be on.|Pisces|Virgo|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|2|5|When your heart is gently touched, it feels loving, generous, and supportive of everyone, Leo. If your heart is lonely, it feels deserted by everyone. It would be impossible to try to make sense of why things need to be so extreme for you, but the fact of the matter is that you don't need to figure it out rationally. You only need to accept that this is how you feel.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|2|6|You may be like a giant trying to befriend a small bug, Virgo. You have absolutely nothing in common and don't even speak the same language. With one accidental move, you could easily squash that little bug. This isn't to say that you can't learn to become best friends. Just know that this kind of relationship is going to take some work.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|2|7|There is irony in today's situation, Libra. The only real remedy for situations like this is to accept them and joke about it. If you try to take yourself too seriously, especially when it comes to art or romance, you will inevitably fail. Your heart is sensual and your emotions profound. Bring yourself into balance by laughing instead of crying about the events of the day.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|2|8|The hungrier you get, the more determined you will become, Scorpio. Be careful that your determination doesn't turn into desperation and neediness. It's unattractive and will get you nowhere. Keep on the upward spiral, and let determination turn into inspiration and cooperation. You will find this especially true when it comes to matters of the heart. You have a great deal of power. Put it to good use.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|2|9|If you're in the market for romance, Sagittarius, whether with a new partner or rekindling the fire with a current partner, be careful. Small issues could rage out control today. Extreme conditions are likely to occur, thanks to your sensitive emotions combined with a surge of energy from the outside. Try not to get too upset when tension rises because of something unimportant.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|2|10|Things may get a bit difficult in your romantic life because of someone in the partnership who isn't necessarily taking a very realistic approach to the situation, Capricorn. There's a bit of a power play going on as someone tries to throw their weight around without considering the other person's feelings. Tension is brewing, and you'd be wise to deal with it now.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|2|11|Your creative juices are flowing freely, Aquarius, but there appears to be a roadblock. Something or someone apparently doesn't want you to continue down the path you're on. Perhaps he or she is scared that you're going to discover a whole new passion in life that they don't necessarily agree with. Don't forget who is running your show - you and no one else.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|2|12|At the end of the day, you're the one who has to look in the mirror and know who you are, Pisces. Think about this the next time you're tempted to make a rude comment or spread a displeasing fact about someone else. One side of you may be able to rationalize behavior that the other side simply despises. Today look at both of sides of yourself, not just the one that please you.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|3|1|Too much running around might have you feeling exhausted and under the weather today, Aries. You may have been exercising a little too much. Therefore, this is a good day to avoid exercise and get some rest. Don't push yourself too hard! This isn't a good day to plan or start a vacation. Wait a few days, as trips planned at this time could be fraught with glitches.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|3|2|You could feel extremely passionate today, Taurus. You might want to connect with a love partner but be prevented by circumstances. You might be attracted to racier novels or movies. Repressed anger could bubble up from your subconscious and seek an outlet. This is a great day to channel that anger into some artistic activity. Don't be surprised if you use a lot of red!|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|3|3|Electrical or plumbing problems with your house might come up. Call a professional, Gemini. Don't try to fix it yourself, because you could make it worse. Friends might want to visit, but tell them to wait until another day. Discussions could quickly deteriorate into arguments today. This is a great day to work quietly alone on whatever interests you the most.|Aquarius|Leo|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|3|4|Stay close to home today, Cancer. Spending too much time in the car could lead to stress or, in extreme cases, minor accidents. On the job, this could turn out to be one of those days. Avoid office politics and stay out of arguments. Try to sequester yourself and do your work alone. Days like this are best used to take care of your affairs quickly and efficiently.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|3|5|Money matters might take a turn for the worse today. Don't fly off the handle because of this, Leo. Use every bit of financial savvy you have to put things straight. Try to remain calm and collected when dealing with stubborn people. Don't be drawn into arguments. You will be able to pull everything together again, but only by your ingenuity. Don't depend on others.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|3|6|Virgo, check your house to make certain everything is in working order. There are indications that small hazards could exist that need correcting. Tension might run high among family members, and quarrels could result. Don't waste time trying to mediate. They will have to work it out for themselves. This is a great day for study and solitude, since your mind is especially sharp.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|3|7|Short visits in your neighborhood could catapult you into some negative situations, Libra. It's best to stay close to home if you can. An angry letter or call could put you in a shaky mood. This isn't a day to socialize. Days like this are best spent keeping to yourself and throwing your energy into taking care of whatever you're working on.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|3|8|Today you might be a bit worried about your financial affairs, Scorpio. A past mistake could have led to some rather upsetting consequences. Now you need to harness every bit of skill you have in order to set things straight. Your knowledge of modern technology could help. A friend might try to pick a quarrel with you, but it's best to stay cool, neutral, and out of the discussion.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|3|9|Your physical energy is very high today, Sagittarius. You're likely to want to get out and exercise, perhaps jog through the park or attend an aerobics class. Be careful! You might not be as fit as you think, and trying too hard could cause minor injuries. Someone you know professionally might not be in a great mood. You could get swept up in their anger. Try to stay out of it.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|3|10|Uncertainty about spiritual matters and doubt about your insights might have you down in the dumps today. Don't try to force any solutions - it won't work. This isn't a good day to be out and about, because travel of any kind could pose problems. This is also a bad day to plan or start a vacation. Stay close to home and take care of practicalities, Capricorn. That way you will be calm by evening.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|3|11|If a friend or acquaintance gives you advice about money or investments today, don't take it. To follow this unknowledgeable person's lead might prove to be disastrous. Participation in group activities also isn't advisable. They could get out of hand, and you could find end up in the middle of an angry crowd. This is a great day to stay home, Aquarius. Work on your own project.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|3|12|Gossip and bad feelings among co-workers or in a group could occur today, and there might be some political shenanigans that it would be in your best interests to avoid. This isn't a good day to go to lunch with co-workers. Get away by yourself. Don't believe anything you hear. Chances are it isn't true. Keep to yourself and don't offer any opinions, Pisces. To do so might be unfortunate.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|4|1|If you feel you've been looking to the past lately, Aries, it's in order to liberate yourself from it. You may feel like revisiting your childhood or rekindling certain relationships with old friends. But the planets are making you a bit too romantic, and the reality of things will disappoint you. Looking backward isn't the best way to move toward the future. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be!|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|4|2|Sometimes your relationships are like magnets, Taurus. When you want to get close, the other person tries to get away from you. When you take a step back, he or she runs back into your life. Human nature is complex. Right now you're probably taking a step back, although you haven't given up completely. This rest will give you time to think about which side of you is the most magnetic.|Capricorn|Cancer|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|4|3|You're entering a period of doubt, especially about your love life. You like your relationships and feelings to be clear. You may think a lot about your relationships over the next few days. Are you sure you've chosen the right person? Are his or her feelings sincere? Could you live without this person? The next two months will bring you the answers. Don't forget, no one is perfect.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|4|4|"For a month you may have had problems communicating with the people close to you, Cancer. This is nothing to worry about, yet it might make you feel off balance. This is a great day to settle conflicts from the last month or make your feelings clear to other people. Don't be afraid to play ""truth or dare."" Honesty is the best policy. Dare them to be honest with you."|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|4|5|Leo, you have a tendency to live your life vicariously through your partner. Today you may come to the realization that this isn't healthy for you. You may realize that you give more of yourself than you get back, draining you of energy. In fact, you're almost completely out. Be selfish today. You need to do something for you for once, and it's about time!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|4|6|Virgo, you see new horizons. It's possible that the changes you've been going through lately aren't completely finished. You may even have a hard time keeping yourself from running away from it all. Your rebirth will only be complete after you clearly define your desires. Use today to think about what you want. Things aren't completely clear.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|4|7|Libra, you hide your emotional needs from others. You need to be able to trust someone in order to share your feeling. They have to guess at your deepest secrets. Today you could save a lot of time in your love life if you just tell your partner what you want out of your relationship or even what you'd like to change about it. Talk about it. Your partner is listening.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|4|8|Today you may want to change some of the moral and social values that get in the way of relationships. After surmounting these kinds of obstacles yourself, and watching others struggle with them, you've decided that it's time to do away with them once and for all. Just be careful to respect the private lives of the people close to you. Not everyone is as open-minded as you are!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|4|9|Sagittarius, the people around you sometimes have a hard time understanding where you're going. You're living in an imaginary world that has little to do with reality. If you decide to stay home and lie around the house, you will have no problems. If you have to go to work, try to be as clear as possible with others. If you don't, your proposals could fall on deaf ears.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|4|10|You may have doubts over the next few days, Capricorn. Don't make any important decisions about your future during this relatively unproductive period. If someone in your professional or personal life asks you to make more of a commitment, you may be tempted to put on the brakes without really knowing why. Wait a while before answering this kind of question.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|4|11|What are you afraid of, Aquarius? Is it contact with other people? It's as if an invisible rope were holding you back from getting close to people, or worse, pulling you back. What's this about? You're going through a period that's closely linked to your past. A failed relationship still haunts you and casts its shadow on the current one. Get rid of the skeletons in your closet!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|4|12|It's very possible that you will want to take a step back today in order to take a closer look at your relationships. Your address book is full of names. Your phone rings off the hook. You receive tons of texts and emails every day. Yet isn't it funny that you feel alone? It's time to get rid of the superficial relationships and concentrate on those that really mean something to you.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|5|1|You may have spent the past few weeks exploring new horizons, meeting new people, going out more frequently in the evening, or even making short trips away from home. But this is a moment to settle down. Today's celestial configuration is giving you the incentive you need to stabilize yourself. Expect some pleasurable moments in the comfort of your home, Aries.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|11|5|2|You're likely to enjoy today's change of tone, Taurus. Don't you feel a need to take friendships beyond the superficial level? Perhaps you should reestablish contact with some former friends, too, although you may find that you have some bonds to repair. In any case, you can expect another month devoted to sweeping the cobwebs out of your emotional universe in order to let in sunlight and promise.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|5|3|Today, Gemini, you can expect to be somewhat more enterprising in your relationships. You may find new friends or enjoy spending quality time with some old ones. Perhaps you will look forward to an intensification of your love life. With today's planetary configuration, you will surely find excellent resources for improving your emotional well-being.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|5|4|Recent aspects have allowed you to affirm yourself at work and, in a more general way, cement some aspects of your personality. Now you will be consolidating things. It's as if you've conceived of a product, created it, and are now finally ready to put it on the market. If this is in fact the case, Cancer, the current period corresponds to incoming money - and profits.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|5|5|Today's planetary aspects herald the beginning of an especially agreeable period. You will carry confidence, clarity, and positive influence wherever you go, Leo. You've used up a lot of your reserves recently and made it to this stage just in the nick of time. Enjoy your new strength.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|5|6|Today's planetary configurations indicate that this would be a good moment to get rid of everything that's still holding you back from an impending rebirth, Virgo. One stumbling block for you may be the impulse that you seem to have to blend in with others. You're an individual, Virgo. This isn't something to overcome. It should be celebrated!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|5|7|Today's planetary configurations indicate that you can expect a very profitable period coming up, Libra. You've worked hard lately, and it's only natural that you should finally arrive at this stage. You're going to be able to measure the distance you've come, and above all, evaluate your power. Whatever you do, think big!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|5|8|Today's aspects ask you to make more of an effort, Scorpio. You will have to come back down to Earth and join the rest of us mere mortals. You may be cultivating your independence a bit too much. It pulls you away from people. You should try to mingle and get involved in a cause that's bigger than you. Working with others is a necessary part of any job.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|5|9|You can interpret today's aspects in several ways, Sagittarius. The planetary configurations correspond to a search for space, whether physical or intellectual. You may be asking yourself philosophical questions, or perhaps you're thinking of taking a long trip. What will you decide to do? Will you read Kant or plan a trip to China?|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|5|10|In navigating the seas of your emotional life, Capricorn, you may feel as though you've made a great effort over the past month. You've been available and conciliatory and have done your best to maintain harmony. With today's celestial energy, you want to be more spontaneous. The enterprising and reckless you has returned!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|5|11|With today's celestial configuration, your emotional universe will once again glow with positive energy. You will be meeting more people, and your encounters are likely to be more profound. The coming weeks are quite promising for you, Aquarius. The music will be in the key to pleasure and sensuality. Allow the music to fill your senses!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|5|12|For you, Pisces, the changing planetary configuration portends a period of timidity. You will probably go out less, introduce yourself to fewer new people, and be less prone to show off. But any relationships you form will be much more intense than usual. The weeks ahead are quite promising, although you may have to readjust some of your attitudes.|Scorpio|Taurus|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|6|1|Love and passion are at the forefront of your thoughts today, Aries. Work seems tedious compared to the rich fantasy inside your head! If possible, make a point of getting together tonight with your mate. He or she is likely feeling as amorous as you. You two have much to celebrate. The celestial atmosphere is conducive to the deepening of your relationship.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|6|2|If you became an animal today, you'd be a puppy, Taurus, all frisky and affectionate. By all means, put your passion to good use! Surprise a special someone with a home-cooked meal. Set a table in front of the fireplace, light candles, pour the wine, and let nature take its course. You need not bother to plan a dessert. There's wonderful energy flowing between you. The sparks will fly!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|6|3|You have a creative and artistic nature that you might want to put to good use today, Gemini. You could have some good ideas for home improvements. Perhaps you need some bookcases to help you get organized, or maybe you want a complete redecoration. Whatever you do, Gemini, it's bound to look beautiful. When it comes to artistic endeavors, you definitely have the touch.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|6|4|You may miss friends and family who live far away, Cancer. Why not make yourself a cup of tea and write some letters? It will help you feel connected in a different way than sending an email or making a call. Remember that you're blessed to have these people in your life even if you don't see them as often as you'd like.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|6|5|You may have recently inherited either some money or some free time. This is a real gift, and if invested wisely, it could lead to some important self-discoveries. Perhaps you could use the money to enroll in college, take music lessons, or do something else that makes your heart soar. If you received free time, you could catch up on reading, paint, or try some writing.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|6|6|Today is well suited for making new friends, Virgo. Your sense of adventure is undoubtedly up to it! You will be your usual confident self, but others will seem to respond to your charisma even more than usual. At a party, you may meet someone who lives far away who invites you to visit at a later date. What a wonderful opportunity for travel!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|6|7|This is a very spiritual and creative day for you, Libra. You're especially intuitive. Any creative effort will likely resonate deeply. Even if you don't feel you have the talent for it, why not try some form of artistic expression? You could dabble with a paintbrush or makes notes in a journal. Don't let that pesky internal editor kick in. Create for the sheer joy of it.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|6|8|Today is ideal for romance, Scorpio. It's great for forming new relationships or improving existing ones. If you don't have a special someone, make an effort to expand your social circle. Attend a lecture or take a workshop. If you have a mate, do something different together that helps you get to know one another better. A spiritual retreat might be just the boost your relationship needs.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|6|9|You have a good heart, Sagittarius, and today it expands to bestow love on all mankind. You can't help but feel connected in a deep, spiritual way with all who have come before you and all who follow. Even if you don't have a lot of money, consider setting up an annual giving plan that will benefit worthwhile causes. This would be a direct expression of your feelings and could potentially help many people.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|6|10|You will likely find it difficult to keep your mind on serious matters with today's playful planetary energies, Capricorn. You're in the mood for romance, and you want to make sure everything is in place for a flawless evening out with that special someone. You have the sexy outfit and dinner reservations, and that's just for starters. No wonder you can't concentrate, with such an amazing evening to look forward to.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|6|11|Your innate talent and conscientious work ethic earn you admiration and respect. Whether you're aware of it or not, others look up to you as someone who has it together. Yet you still have that nagging doubt that you're an impostor. Today's astral energies ask you to look at where these doubts originate. It's time to get to the source and exorcise the monsters for good! They have nothing to do with your success.|Libra|Aries|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|6|12|It looks as though you're about to hop on the bandwagon, Pisces. Friends will try to get you to support one of their causes. Think carefully. They aren't going to settle for a check. They want your hands-on support. While you might be intimidated by addressing a crowd, you always did want to use a megaphone. Volunteer for a night and see how it goes. You may enjoy it.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|7|1|You could develop a stomachache if you try to sort out all the confused issues of the day, Aries. There are apt to be too many matters for you to handle alone, so don't even try. It's one of those situations in which you start to untangle one knot only to create another somewhere down the line. It's best to just let the ball of string lie where it is for now.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|7|2|You may have your mind set on some big plans that you've been working on for some time now, Taurus. The problem is that today there is some conflict with something or someone with a large ego who suddenly wants a piece of the pie. Either that or this person wants to burst your bubble. Don't give up hope on your dreams. Realize that this opposition is just part of the adventure.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|7|3|You may have been feeling more emotional lately, Gemini. Today a fanciful energy could sweep you off your feet and into another realm entirely. Feel free to take off for at least a little while in order to gain a better perspective on the issues at hand. Strong, forceful powers are urging you to let someone else take the reins on a particular project.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|7|4|People and situations that you were counting on may suddenly run into opposition today, Cancer. Don't be surprised if the seat you're sitting on is suddenly pulled out from under you. Make sure you have some extra padding, since it could be a rather hard fall. More than likely, however, you will be able to take it in stride.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|7|5|Your ego has probably been feeling strong lately, and you may feel an extra boost of self-confidence, Leo. Don't be surprised if your ego gets threatened by someone who appears out of the blue with an aggressive, opinionated attitude, someone who isn't on quite the same track as you. You may find it hard to deal with people today, since they could be a bit spacey.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|7|6|If you knew the truth of all the things that are going on outside your world, you'd be appalled, Virgo. You shouldn't take things at face value today. It's important to simply go and see things for yourself. Don't trust another's word on what is true and what isn't. Question what you see. Make sure you don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|7|7|It isn't a good idea to try to fit people into a mold today, Libra. This will only annoy others and frustrate you. It's important that you relax and simply let people blossom into the people they want to be. If you have a preconceived notion of who they should be, you're only setting yourself up for failure and disappointment, as well as anger from the other party.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|7|8|Consider subscribing to an alternative newsletter of some sort, Scorpio. You will find some amazing information that the general public doesn't necessarily know. Knowledge is power. For the most part, common knowledge is quite limited. Make an effort to seek news from a wider community. Some mainstream information is pretty unreliable.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|7|9|Don't expect others to take much notice of your emotions today, Sagittarius. You're more respectful of theirs than they are of yours. Find peace among all you encounter. This could be difficult, since other people's wills are involved. In that case, people aren't likely to back down. Others think they're right and refuse to see things any other way.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|7|10|Your aggressive attitude is likely to start a fight that might be difficult to settle now, Capricorn. There are extremely stubborn forces at work, and you may find that no one is willing to budge from their position. The thing that is apt to make this even more difficult is that people may misinterpret certain pieces of the puzzle. Try to bring understanding to the situation instead of more aggression.|Virgo|Pisces|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|7|11|People may be difficult to deal with today, Aquarius. You may soon discover that they're just as stubborn as you are. Try to give others the benefit of the doubt or there will be a stalemate in just about every corner of your life. Don't consider it a loss or failure of character if you find you need to make some concessions in order to get things to work.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|7|12|Your ego may be under some stress today, Pisces. The tricky part is that the threat you feel is probably a result of something that isn't even completely real. It could be that someone is acting on false information that has no bearing on the reality of the situation. You might be swept away by someone else's false impression of who you really are.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|1|This isn't a day for sensitive people like you, Aries. In fact, the one who shouts the loudest and bangs on the table the hardest is likely to come out the winner today. The air of violence will also have an effect on you. You will be somewhat upset, very thin-skinned, and much more vulnerable than usual. It would be wise to try to stay away from commotion if you can.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|8|2|Some differences of opinion concerning your love life are likely to come up today, Taurus. For example, you may find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself. Take your irritation as a sign that this particular relationship could use some freshening up. The day ahead may bring you just what you seek.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|8|3|This day isn't likely to be the highlight of your week, Gemini. You may be aware of constraints at work or home. You're quite likely to hanker for an appropriate reward for your labor. Any type of recognition would be nice at this point. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They'll sustain you through your unending chores.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|4|It may be that you've been a bit too stubborn lately. You've been doing whatever you want, giving no consideration to financial constraints. Now it's urgent that you take care of any unresolved monetary issues. You definitely have some lessons to learn in the area of fiscal responsibility, Cancer! Do what you can to raise your awareness.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|5|You may find yourself in a situation where you need to choose whether or not to commit to a relationship, Leo. Old demons could come back to haunt you, renewing doubts and creating fears about a lack of freedom. Ignore these demons at all costs! If you give in to them, you're likely to lose a lot of ground. Be courageous and make a decision on your own.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|8|6|Today is going to be a great day for you, Virgo. You aren't one to embrace rules, constraints, or restrictions of any kind, preferring instead to reside in a fantasy world where no limitations apply. Have you considered that it's possible for you to join the rest of us here on Earth and still retain your liberty and ideals?|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|8|7|It's important that you abandon the myth that you don't have any gifts or talents, Libra. Consider thinking about your talents in the same way you think about your body. When you exercise, eat right, and get plenty of rest, your body responds. Your talents are no different. They need care and nurturing, too.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|8|If you're waiting for someone to come and fill all of your needs, emotional ones in particular, you may have to wait a very long time! You're responsible for fulfilling your own needs, Scorpio. If you don't, you will be eternally dependent. This would be unlike Scorpio, and certainly unlike you!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|8|9|If you have children, their difficulties may remind you of your own, Sagittarius. Or it may simply be that their education brings back memories of yours. Are you holding onto an issue from a period in your life that still bothers you? This would be a good moment to ask yourself the question. Ask it, then answer it and put it to rest once and for all!|Leo|Aquarius|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|8|10|Don't spend beyond your means today, Capricorn! If you happen to be in a crowd of enthusiastic shoppers, it could be disastrous for your finances if you get caught up in the frenzy. On the other hand, perhaps you owe yourself a reward for all your hard work. Is there a gift you could give yourself that doesn't involve money? Time, perhaps?|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|11|Minor tensions could arise today, Aquarius. People close to you, perhaps your mate or parents, seem to be trying to force you to adopt a behavior that you aren't at all willing to follow. Will you negotiate your independence gently or tear yourself free from their domination? The second possibility seems more likely.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|8|12|The mood may be oppressive today, Pisces. After meeting the challenges of the past several days, you're now in need of some well-deserved peace and quiet! Alas, the authorities are unwilling to give it to you. You can expect to be unceremoniously deposited at your desk. Work, it seems, won't wait until you've had a nap. Why not plan an exotic vacation?|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|9|1|As a person who embodies affection and tenderness, Aries, you may feel especially resentful about today's mood. It will be difficult to charm a smile out of anyone or achieve any semblance of harmony. Moreover, the friction won't spare siblings - even close friends may quarrel. Prepare to duck and cover, because clashes are likely to occur all around you.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|9|2|A longing for comfort and the small, simple pleasures in life is likely to cripple your initiative today, Taurus. Have you decided to withdraw from the career whirl for the time being? Or perhaps you're just discouraged by the lack of enthusiasm in your colleagues. In any case, this would be a good day to stay home and rest, Taurus.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|9|3|For the past several days, Gemini, you've been fairly lucky in financial and material terms. But the day ahead will be an exception. If you're planning to make an investment, sign a contract, or purchase a major item, postpone it until another day. You may as well resign yourself to this fate and be grateful that you were spared the chance to make a mistake!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|9|4|The way you act when you first meet people is typical of Cancer. What is it that you do? You try to teach them something. It seems that you always have a lesson to impart, making you prone to giving advice when it isn't always wanted. Make an effort to accept the points of view of others for a change.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|9|5|Your philosophy of life comes naturally, Leo. Others need to study, listen to experts, or sign on to various allegiances. You, on the other hand, already have a profound outlook on life that you surely inherited from your past experiences. It would be interesting for you to expand on your philosophy a bit and try to turn it into something concrete.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|9|6|It isn't because your new projects demand such precision that they're causing you problems, Virgo. You tend to think details keep you from having a global vision, but that simply isn't true. There's no conflict between the long-term view and short-term needs. You just think that the latter gets in the way of the former. Try thinking of the details that you find annoying as steppingstones to your larger vision.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|9|7|Yes, Libra, this is a good moment to abandon old beliefs and moral values. Your view of life has changed and, above all, you're more aware of how your outdated, preconceived ideas sometimes poison your life. The past no longer concerns you. It's time for you to make a clean break from the beliefs that are holding you back. You might shock your family, but they'll get over it.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|9|8|If you aren't careful to keep your eyes straight ahead and focused on the future, the past is likely to catch up to you, Scorpio. Don't look back, even if you don't see anything in front of you. You must continue to move forward. It's true that this is easier said than done. Nevertheless, you feel inspired to give it a try.|Cancer|Capricorn|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|9|9|This would be the moment to say yes to your destiny, Sagittarius. You're a little frustrated because things haven't been moving forward the way you'd like. But now that opportunities are coming your way, you find you're holding things up. You're just afraid, that's all. But rather than let your fear overtake you, turn its energy to your advantage.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|9|10|Don't expect to meet the partner of your dreams today, Capricorn. Rather, your romantic hopes are likely to meet with frustration. It would be better to devote your energies to something more realistic, such as your financial situation. It probably does need some attention, wouldn't you agree? If you redirect your energy, the rewards are more likely to be forthcoming.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|9|11|There's some likelihood that a recent meeting with an influential person has put a damper on your hopes for your projects. Will you abandon them and live with regret? Or will you choose to maintain your goals despite advice to the contrary and the risk of encountering disapproval from your supervisors? This is the type of question you will have to resolve today, Aquarius.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|9|12|You will have to expect a few disturbances in the harmony that has reigned over the past few days, Pisces. For example, your needs may not match those of your mate or close friends, or you may feel restless. Minor worries about the future may intrude on people's good moods. In short, this won't be a good day to look to emotional harmony as a source of satisfaction.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|10|1|Is there someone persecuting you, Aries? Is there a situation that feels unbearably oppressive? Today you won't have any trouble identifying the source of your problems. And the great news is that is the first step toward obtaining release from them. But you can't expect it to be easy. The day ahead may feel somewhat overwhelming.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|10|2|Although your current mood is somewhat reserved and modest, you probably feel tempted to strut your stuff every once in a while. However, if you try to show off today, Taurus, you may not be very pleased with your reception. It's natural for you to want to impress people, but you must try to do it with genuine qualities and simplicity. That's true good taste!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|10|3|Obviously, you have an important role to play, Gemini. The mood today may be somewhat frustrating, but the way you handle it will earn you rewards and recognition in your workplace or at school. Your strength, self-control, and stability made the difference between success and failure. You can and should be proud of yourself.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|10|4|"You will feel as though your back is against the wall, Cancer. And this particular wall is impeding your progress. Others will ask you questions and ask for your opinion. You may want to tell them the ""truth"" as you understand it, and you could be tempted to do so humorously. Humor isn't your forte right now. You can always try, but for now a sensible approach is the best one."|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|10|5|Today is likely to be a bit gray, Leo. You won't be able to see how you can get out of your current situation. You may have some financial or physical problems at the moment. If this is the case, it's because you don't rely enough on your abilities and good sense to pull you through. It's possible that you don't take care of your body as well as you should. That's easily remedied.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|10|6|You're wasting your energy, Virgo, and you know it. You go out to dinner, attend parties and shows, but you're never really present. You listen to people but what they're saying doesn't interest you in any fundamental way. Yes, you're bored, and you're afraid to admit it to yourself. The depth of your inner search requires that you use a lot of energy to reexamine your life.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|10|7|It isn't always easy to think about how your life is going, Libra. Imagine if you were alone in the world, with nothing to hold you back or force you to do anything. At least once a month dedicate an hour to visualizing what your life would be like under these conditions. This will help you figure out what's impeding you today.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|10|8|Now is the time to be thinking about your professional orientation, Scorpio. You may need to get some more fun in your life and experience pleasures that you've never had before. You have a certain tendency to separate the two worlds of work and play, but there's no need. In fact, your work will prosper once you discover ways to make it more playful.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|10|9|You may be worn out, Sagittarius, but you will have to push forward anyway. You're entering a long period of work and perseverance. This definitely isn't the moment to be late or balk. If you're still in your pajamas at noon, you should be ashamed! Do what you can to wake yourself from your recent daze. It's time to get up and get moving!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|10|10|In a series of days that have tested your patience to the limit, here comes the moment of truth that could make or break you. You can expect a high-pressure day when you will be induced to express your deepest motivations. A confrontation with an authority figure could trigger an outburst. Do your best to remain levelheaded, Capricorn.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|10|11|Are you hankering for a little fun and longing for a little experimentation and perhaps even childish play? Tempting as these prospects are, you will have to ignore them. Aquarius, you simply don't have the time, at least not today. You will be too busy coping with numerous little emergencies that crop up and having to justify your decisions throughout the day.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|10|12|Do you feel as though your self-expression is being stifled, Pisces? Perhaps you need more time to choose a direction in life. Today, you can expect to feel a lot of pressure from someone close to you. You will feel forced to satisfy this person's demands. Annoying as this may be, you can take comfort in the knowledge that he or she has your best interests at heart.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|1|Aries, you're someone who needs to have a lot of time to yourself. You often dream of curling up in bed with a good book or going for a bike ride. This is just your natural rhythm. Don't try and ignore it, because doing so could only mean problems for you. Give in from time to time. If you don't, at least use today to think about how you could.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|2|This will be a great day for you, Taurus. Everything you touch will seem to turn to gold. The day's events will fall right into place. You will take pleasure in being calm and efficient. But what you may not realize is that this could happen every day. Take the time to see what's going right today in order to make it happen again tomorrow!|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|11|3|Today you may be feeling a little surer of yourself than usual. You can be fairly shy and reserved. Today you should try and make people a little more aware of you, to take you seriously. It's time that people respected you more, especially the people around you. Try to think of yourself before you think of other people. You're worth it!|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|11|4|This would be an ideal day to think about your personal interests in all areas of your life, Cancer. You've surely noticed that in various relationships you tend not to consider yourself and what you get out of it. The configuration of the planets today can help you concentrate on yourself and think about what you give up in return for your need to please others.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|5|Leo, don't be surprised if you meet people who are quite self-centered today. In general, it could be that you have a hard time understanding people who are egotistical and don't participate in activities with others. Today you could try looking at them as if they had something to teach you - the value of living a bit more for yourself and less for others.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|11|6|Today could be rather constraining, Virgo. Despite your great aspirations, today will be marked by the need to take care of the small problems that arise in everyday life. In other words, just what you love. That said, being more down to Earth or in contact with the realities of the world can never do anything but good for you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|11|7|Even if it's true in general that Libra have strong bodies like you, there are times when it's important that they take care of themselves. This would be an ideal day to be more aware of that fact. It isn't that you're going to have health problems. Rather, the planets are positioned in the middle of abundant activity, suggesting that you'd be wise to take care of your body - your greatest asset.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|8|Today might be a little rough for you, Scorpio. It's as if reality were waiting to trip you up. Nothing about you is realistic. If you're still a bit childish or irresponsible, today may be rather hard on you. It's nothing serious, so don't worry. However, if you feel as though your back is to the wall, don't react. Try to calmly accept what's happening to you.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|9|Here's a day that will be rather calm for you, Sagittarius. Peace has replaced all your soul searching. You feel in contact with life's daily routine, including aspects that you don't always consider like the weather, people's expressions, or small coincidences. You seem to be floating on a cloud. You're going to have a good deal of confidence today!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|11|10|It's time to get yourself together. You have a tendency to be all over the place. You need to channel your energies into something you really care about. Tell yourself how proud you would be if you could get this done. Don't give up and don't change directions on your way. Stay focused!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|11|11|Today you should think about your overdependence on money and material possessions, Aquarius. Don't you think you spend too much of your precious time thinking about money and where you're going to find it? Are you careful with your money? Do you stick to or even have a budget? These are important questions and this is a good day to find the answers.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|11|12|The last few weeks have been a little too serious for your tastes, but this is good for you every once in a while, Pisces. You may have a tendency to want to play, which sometimes keeps you from getting your work done. Take today to try and get your daily life organized so you can have time to take care of your responsibilities and have a little fun.|Scorpio|Cancer|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|1|Come out of your shell and be proud of your sensitive side, Aries. Although you may feel vulnerable when it comes to love and romance, this doesn't mean that you have to hide it. You may think that everyone else has it together in this department, but don't be fooled. They're just as insecure as you are! Go ahead and let this side of your personality shine. Admitting your vulnerability is wonderfully attractive.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|2|You shouldn't have any problem getting your way in most areas of life, Taurus. The time is ripe for you to take the lead. Unfortunately, there may be one important part of your life that isn't going exactly to plan, and this is love and romance. It's likely that you will run into a tremendously stubborn attitude that you can't seem to break through. It could be your own.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|12|3|Have fun with loved ones, Gemini. Put your worries aside. Don't think of the possible negative consequences of having a good time. Focus on the fun and excitement of the moment. You have the ability to create fantastically strong bonds between you and your romantic partner. Love is in your favor, so act with confidence. There is no reason to feel bad or insecure in any way. Hold your head high.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|12|4|You're the secret jewel, Cancer. You're apt to be extremely loving and devoted to those who recognize this in you. There is no reason to shrink back and hide. Put on your royal air and flaunt your stuff. Your peaceful, charming nature shines through, and you radiate the god-like qualities you have within. Whoever shares your company tonight is extremely lucky. Make sure this person is worthy of you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|12|5|You may feel locked in a bind of deep emotion and stubborn attitudes with close friends or lovers, Leo. Perhaps it's hard for you to say what you really feel. You may be under the impression that you're being tested and judged by everyone else. Try not to let your ego get in the way of a good time. Say what you feel without getting worried about how others will react.|Aries|Libra|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|6|Your spirit sparkles, Virgo. You may feel filled with tremendous energy as you go about your day. Your sense of adventure is high, and there's very little that gets you down. One area that might be difficult to deal with right now is love and romance. You may feel like this is the one domain in which things aren't going the way you'd like them to. Patience is the secret.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|12|7|You may feel yourself slipping into a deeper understanding with a close friend or loved one, Libra. Romantic situations are heating up, and you're slowly letting your inhibitions fade away so they're completely absent. You realize the exuberance and excitement that come when you come out of hiding and let your playful spirit charm the world. Put serious subjects aside and make time to have fun and be more social.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|12|8|Most of the time it's good to have strong opinions and be independent and willful, Scorpio. But there are other times when this attitude turns people away you're hoping to draw closer. There's a stubborn yet sensitive attitude in your world of romance that may be difficult for you to deal with. Perhaps you're taking a more rational approach to things while your loved one is taking a more emotional one.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|9|Sensual, passionate lovemaking is definitely on the agenda of activities for tonight, Sagittarius. Fun, excitement, romance, and love are all key themes likely to take precedence if you have anything to say about it - and you do. Don't let someone else dictate your path for you. You know what you want, so don't say you don't care when you do. Love is coming your way. Learn how to grab it.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|10|You may feel like the brakes have been slammed in the romance department, Capricorn. Realize that this doesn't mean you have to stop having fun. Laughter and good times are in store for you today as long as you don't get hung up on the slow pace of your love life. You can have a good time while taking things one step at a time. Savor each moment. Don't try to rush to the next.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|12|11|The stars indicate that love and romance are in your favor, Aquarius. You will find that this area of your life is going well. Shower your partner with affection. You honey's ego needs to be stroked. However, don't spoil him or her to the point that your mate becomes self-centered and ends up disregarding all of your wants and needs.|Libra|Gemini|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|12|12|Your sensitive, sensual side is being drawn out, Pisces. You may feel like your romantic side is on display. You're like a dancer onstage, and you accept this role with pleasure! There's a great combination of energies at work letting you become more realistic about love and approach it with dramatic flair and courage. Be more expressive when it comes to your needs and desires.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|1|Have you ever thought of yourself as a CEO or any other kind of leader, Aries? Today is a great day to begin a project involving other people - with you in charge! The strong, assertive side of your personality will come out in your decision making and charisma. Go for it! After all, this is the first day of the rest of your life.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|13|2|There's a lot of tension in the air today, Taurus. Perhaps you feel like no one is listening to you, and that people are draining your energy. You may act defensively and even occasionally become very angry. It's possible that no one has seen in you in such a state before. Don't be afraid to express your anger. Repressed anger is like poison for your body and soul.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|3|As a Gemini, you have an innate gift for healing and calming other people in crisis situations. If this isn't what you do for a living, you should think about doing something with this natural talent. The positions of the planets today may be telling you to think about this in more concrete terms. If you're interested in herbal therapy, for example, this could be the perfect time to learn more.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|13|4|You seem to be a specialist at relationships, and you're very sensitive to the ups and downs in your own. But today you may wonder if people love you less than they did before. This is rather an odd question, but another one may be hiding underneath. Do you really have to make such a big effort in order to be loved? Only you can answer that question.|Pisces|Virgo|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|13|5|You're usually full of energy, Leo, but today you may not feel so vivacious. There's nothing to worry about. In fact, you may have the time to do some thinking about your personal life and what you expect to get out of your relationships. You might also want to think about how you intend to go about getting it! Perhaps some of your motivations have changed lately.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|6|You may have had a hard time lately reaching your objectives. Unfortunately for you, Virgo, today will be no different. You may begin to feel a bit dissatisfied with the way your life is going at the moment. You will ask yourself certain questions about your goals. Does your personal life live up to those goals? Can you express your wonderful creativity as much as you'd like?|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|7|Your sense of responsibility is probably the catalyst for most of your motivation, Libra. But what happens when events are beyond your control and you're powerless to do anything about them? You may have to admit that sometimes you can't control everything, especially your family and friends. Today you should think about letting things happen occasionally. Your life will be a lot less complicated.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|13|8|Today you could put a stop to your activities for a little while, Scorpio. You may take a good, hard look at things and realize that the climate of trust you need in order to be productive and creative is missing at the moment. It's a good time to get some order back into your relationships and remind others of their responsibilities to you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|13|9|What are you after in life, Sagittarius? Deep down, does the kind of work you do satisfy your most intimate desires? The little problems you encounter in your professional life over the next week could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Take a look around to see if the work you do and the people in your life take your profoundly spiritual nature into account.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|10|It's possible that you're trying to do too much, Capricorn. If look at the days you spend working, you may realize that too much of your energy goes to some very meager results. Today, consider taking some time off to take advantage of life. Why not go out for a nice dinner with friends, or even better, go on a little vacation? Try and let things happen. You deserve time just for you!|Virgo|Taurus|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|13|11|It's possible that you could be in conflict with people of the opposite sex today, Aquarius. You may feel as if they put obstacles in front of you and slow you down. But instead of getting into conflicts that could eventually escalate into full-blown confrontations, try and ask yourself what they think you're doing wrong. Does your personality take into account both your masculine and feminine sides?|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|13|12|You have a very dynamic day ahead of you, Pisces. You may feel the need to put all your energy into a group project. You will want to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You're usually a meditative, pensive person, but today you're looking for concrete results and actions. Who knows? This hard work might even help you relax a little.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|14|1|Your career and financial goals should be within your grasp, Aries. Both your physical energy and inner power are operating at their peak, making this an ideal day to make clear plans. Also, if you've been working to improve your health, you might see some definite results. If not, this is a great day to start a new health and exercise regimen. Go to it!|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|14|2|Today you're likely to feel like the powerful creature you are, Taurus. Your physical energy is high, and you look and feel great. Your intellect is sharp, so if you indulge in any kind of learning process, you will benefit greatly. Your creative energy is also high, so it's a good day to work on artistic projects. In the evening, you will feel especially romantic, so plan an intimate encounter with a special someone!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|14|3|Your intuition should be very high right now, Gemini, as is your power of manifestation.

Some powerful dreams and visions can open up new lines of intellectual exploration for you that can have a potent effect on your immediate future. Go to it.|Aquarius|Leo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|14|4|Your immediate goals and wishes might suddenly appear to come together today, seemingly of their own accord. This might be strange, Cancer, and perhaps a bit frightening, but your inner power is especially strong now, and your higher self is manifesting what you've worked long and hard to achieve. At times like this, it's important to remember those who helped you along the way. You will want to acknowledge them as well as yourself.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|14|5|If you've been working toward manifesting extra money in your life, Leo, you will probably see it happen today. Copious physical and emotional energy gives your inner power of mind over matter a special impetus, and you might see the results you've wanted in finance and other matters. Professional interests should also be going well, as well as any personal projects. Keep up the good work!|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|14|6|Obstacles that you encountered in attaining your cherished goals could suddenly seem to melt away, clearing the way to make your dreams come true, Virgo. This could involve physical health, plans for travel and education, and self-expression. You could also feel especially passionate now, so a romantic evening with that special someone would be particularly enjoyable. You feel great, so look your best, too!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|14|7|A lot of activity could occur at home today, Libra. Perhaps you will have visitors or do some work on the house. Your intuition is particularly strong right now, and you could pick up too much of the thoughts and feelings of others, even strangers. You will probably be most in tune with your family. Take care to guard your thoughts. Today you might find that whatever you think of could actually manifest.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|14|8|Whatever goals you've been trying to reach may finally become reality today, Scorpio. Finalizing everything could involve a lot of running around in the car and meeting with other people, but you're likely to feel exhilarated all the same.

2016|11|14|9|Events over which you seem to have no control seem to be coming together to make things happen for you, Sagittarius. You might find this a bit frightening, but don't let it get to you. Go with the flow. You've worked hard for what's happening today, and you deserve to enjoy the results. The exhilaration you feel could manifest as abundant physical energy. This could be too much of a good thing. Don't overdo.|Leo|Aries|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|14|10|Your energy is probably high today, almost to the point where you feel you might be able to run a marathon! Seriously, Capricorn, you're probably thinking in terms of getting out of town for a while. Exercising or participating in sports could also be appealing. You might direct some of this energy into creative projects. Take care not to overdo it. You could still get too tired.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|14|11|Your inner power is probably at an all-time high, Aquarius. You should be feeling especially confident. You're likely to have a stronger influence on others than usual. You could exercise the power of mind over matter. You could think of something only to have it happen at some point during the day. Today you should guard your thoughts and be careful what you wish for. You just might get it!|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|14|12|Some fascinating conversations with friends, relatives, and others close to you could take place today, bringing new ideas your way, Pisces.

Carefully consider your needs and aspirations and formulate a plan of action to make them a reality. The results might surprise you!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|1|Inspiration in various contexts could fill your mind today, Aries.

2016|11|15|2|Social events with artistically or spiritually inclined people could have you feeling especially inspired, Taurus, and looking forward to the future in whatever discipline interests you. You're also likely to be feeling especially romantic and sexy. You will want to schedule time alone with that special someone in your life. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone special today.|Capricorn|Cancer|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|3|Today you might feel inspired to help others less fortunate, Gemini. The opportunity to do some volunteer work could come your way, perhaps for a church, charity, or other humanitarian organization. Or you could throw yourself into an artistic discipline. Either way, you're likely to enjoy yourself immensely and meet some interesting people in the process. Fundraising could be involved in some way.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|15|4|Creativity and romance are the words for today, Cancer. Artistic or other creative projects are likely to catch the attention of others, perhaps bringing valuable contacts your way. As a result, you're likely to be inspired to move ahead to new ones. You're also likely to feel especially romantic and sexy. If you're currently involved, expect to grow closer to your partner. If you aren't, you might meet someone special.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|15|5|A group of people oriented toward artistic, spiritual, or humanitarian pursuits could meet today at your home to work on advancing their projects. Among them could be someone very special who might play a positive role in your life. As a result of this gathering you could find inspiration to move ahead with personal projects. In the evening, see a romantic movie or go on a hot date!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|6|Errands or other short journeys in your neighborhood could result in a chance meeting with someone who could be of great benefit to you in the future, Virgo. Opportunities to advance your educational, artistic, or spiritual interests could open up as a result of this meeting. When you go out, make sure you look your best even if you're only going to the grocery store.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|7|Today you might hear of opportunities to make extra money through creative work of some kind, Libra. This could be a genuine lucky break achieved by being in the right place at the right time. You will probably take advantage of it, because right now you're full of inspiration. You might have a hard time keeping track of all your ideas. Write them down!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|15|8|Today you should be looking and feeling great. You might attract some admiring looks from passersby on the street. Sex and romance might be on your mind, Scorpio. You're likely to want to spend the day with your special someone. You could also channel those feelings into creative activities of some kind. Information may come your way that sets your mental juices flowing. Make the most of it!|Cancer|Pisces|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|9|Your mind is full of wonderful thoughts today, Sagittarius. You might consider spending the day meditating, doing some volunteer work, or turning your inspiration into an artistic project of some kind. Your intuition is especially high, so you might tune in more acutely than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Take a few minutes during the day to be alone with your thoughts. You will probably benefit from it.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|15|10|A desire to be creative could have you experimenting with various kinds of artistic disciplines, perhaps in connection with computers, Capricorn. At some point today you could be in the right place at the right time, receiving just the right help from someone who can point you in whatever direction you want to go. Ambitious plans could fill your head and keep your mind buzzing. Make a list! It might help.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|15|11|Artistic inspiration could come from deep within at some point today, perhaps even from a dream or vision. You're likely to have a lot of energy to pour into creativity right now, Aquarius, and if you work hard and don't lose sight of the business side of the arts, you could move forward. Don't be surprised if you suddenly meet the right person to give you the right advice!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|15|12|Today you might toy with the idea of publishing, exhibiting, or otherwise making public whatever creative innovations you've been working on, Pisces. Spiritual information could come your way from afar, perhaps through friends or a group with which you're affiliated. Inspiration of all kinds could pop in and out of your head, so it might be best to write down your thoughts.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|16|1|Today's energy may highlight your popularity, Aries. The transits boost your enthusiasm and energy for doing things. People will feel drawn to you. You might even find that others look up to you. This kind of popularity can make you feel special and lucky. On the flip side, it can make you think you're better than you are. Don't get carried away. Use this influence for good.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|16|2|Today should present a very positive influence for you, Taurus. The energy at play will allow for such things as making excellent decisions. Things will go more quickly than usual. Cooperation from colleagues, physical energy, and a sharp mind will support you. What more could you ask? You may find that almost everything goes your way and laughter fills the hours. Give yourself a pat on the back, because you should be able to handle everything.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|16|3|Be tactful when speaking today, Gemini. With this day's energy, it's important that you take the time to think about how your words affect the person you're talking to. It can be easier than usual to say the wrong thing, especially if you're in the position of telling someone something you think might not go over too well. Avoid comments that suggest criticism of the person rather than the deed.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|16|4|Today, Cancer, don't be too surprised if you have difficulty getting into a work frame of mind. It's likely that you'd rather daydream than be in the real world. You're susceptible to daydreaming and taking imaginative trips. Consider making a list of everything that you need to do to help you focus. This will help you meet your short-term objectives, and you can take it easy this evening.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|16|5|You may find today that people are really attracted to you as a friend. This is because you're usually a good listener. You're open to other people's ideas and thoughts and can care easily. Consider noticing those around you to see if there isn't someone who could use a hug or an ear to listen to a problem. It may not take a lot to get someone talking.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|16|6|It's good to dream, especially on days like today, Virgo. Expanding your mind and thinking of possibilities are positive ways to increase your knowledge. Give yourself time to think. Why not lie on your back and watch the clouds or stars? Let yourself dream about things that may not seem practical or possible. Many real things have come out of someone's dreams. Your creativity will flourish if you take the time.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|16|7|With today's energy, you might want to let your imagination run free for a while, Libra. This can add a real boost, as it will connect you with your inner self. Let your imagination be your ticket to your creative and artistic abilities. Problem-solving skills can also be accented or realized when the mind has time to roam. This part of you is as important as your heart, so use it to the fullest.|Gemini|Aquarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|16|8|Today you may meet a new friend, Scorpio. People tend to feel comfortable around you even if they're different than you are. That's because you usually accept the fact that everyone is different and that's OK. This is a rare and special quality - not everyone is as open-minded as you! Plan to do something with your new friend or hang out with another special person. There will be no lack of people interested in spending time with you.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|16|9|You have an incredible imagination, Sagittarius. Today is a great day to put it to use. Take time to engage in creative activities and try meditation, story planning, role playing, or visualization. You have a powerful tool to unlock inner fears and inhibitions, increasing your confidence and creativity and solving life's challenges. If this is a new idea for you, consider learning more about meditation to connect with your inner self.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|16|10|Chances are good that you will feel strong and confident today, Capricorn. It's a good time to try something you've never done before. You might be the right person to get things started, especially if it's about something you want to see changed. If you've never run for office before or taken a leadership role in another area, consider doing this. You have the power and popularity to make a real difference.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|16|11|The energy of the day should have you feeling pretty good, Aquarius. Your spirits should be high, and laughing may well be a good part of your day. When you laugh, it gets other people going. This is a powerful effect to have. You may find that you can transfer the enthusiasm and good feelings you have to those around you. Share your positive energy by smiling, laughing, and just being yourself.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|16|12|Expect a boost in popularity today, Pisces. One way to put this to good use is to bring about change. Perhaps you and your co-workers feel that the workplace needs a new program, such as benefits. You'd be a good one to present this to the decision makers. Even if it's been done before, use your popularity to start a petition or find creative ways to make a group more effective.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|1|Take it slow and easy today, Aries. With the energy from the day's aspects, rushing around isn't likely to get you too far. In fact, you're more apt to make mistakes or leave a bunch of things unfinished. Make your to-do list and go about each thing one at a time at an even pace. Even if you don't finish everything, what you accomplish will be done well.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|17|2|It may be time to look at where you are in life, Taurus. Are you where you thought you'd be? If so, congratulations. This is a real accomplishment. If not, take heart. Many people discover that they aren't anywhere close. The key is to write down solid goals and the steps needed to reach them. It's your life after all. Mapping out your route is up to you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|17|3|If you're feeling irritable and wrung out today, Gemini, it may be a result of putting far too much pressure on yourself. It might be wise to take a look at the expectations you have of yourself. Consider if you would you place the same demands on those closest to you. If the answer is no, it's time to revamp your life to suit the one you're closest to - you.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|4|Consider whether or not you're spending enough time with everyone who's special to you, Cancer. If more hours are going to work colleagues, friends, or partner, there might be an imbalance that you need to look at. Sit down and create a chart of where your time has gone lately. If one portion is considerably larger than the others, make a point of spending some time with the people represented by the smaller portions.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|5|"If your partner acts quickly on his or her passions today, Leo, you will probably want to slow things down a bit. ""Nice and easy"" is the phrase of the day for you, so create an environment that will allow for more time in such circumstances. Let your partner know how you feel and what you'd like to see happen. No one is a mind reader. There's far less chance of any misunderstanding when there is open communication.
                
               "|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|17|6|Consider planning a romantic interlude, Virgo. With the influence from today's planetary aspects, it will be easy to connect with that special someone. Go out for dinner with your spouse or partner or make a date with someone new who's caught your eye. Don't let shyness or insecurity stand in your way. If you're single, consider loving the most important person in your life - you - by doing something special.|Taurus|Capricorn|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|7|"If someone takes too long to do something today, Libra, your temper may flare up. Patience isn't always your strong suit, and you may believe in the ""if you want it done right, do it yourself"" philosophy. This isn't always fair. Others need to do things at their own pace, and in some cases, it's essential that you give them the room to do so. Take a deep breath if you have to, and be patient."|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|17|8|You might find it rather tough to take criticism today, Scorpio. This is something that's hard for many to hear, but it truly depends on your perspective. Rather than view it as a personal attack, try to see the value in the criticism. If you're honest with yourself and recognize that you could learn and grow from critique, seize it as an opportunity. If you find that it's out in left field, then leave it there.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|17|9|Be careful not to fall prey to your own idealism today, Sagittarius. While this is one of your most admirable qualities, as it contributes to your romantic, creative nature, too much of anything can be harmful. It's important to see things as they are, despite how much you may wish them to be different. The real world doesn't always go hand in hand with your ideal place. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|10|Don't be surprised if you feel a real need for some breathing room today, Capricorn. As much as you enjoy the company of others, you need to have time to yourself as well. See if you can work in a private space or simply shut your door. If you need to move in order to be alone, hop in the car and go. Irritability is a good indicator of when you need to get away from the crowd.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|17|11|If things haven't been going too well with those you spend most of your time with, Aquarius, it might be time to consider your expectations of them. Ask what kinds of demands you place on others and if they're fair. Is it possible that you expect the same from others that you give, but perhaps they aren't able to match your level of performance? Consider talking with the people involved to find out how they feel.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|17|12|A little romantic time with your special someone may be in order today, Pisces. With the day-to-day chaos of working and living, it can be tough to get some quality time alone. If you don't make specific plans, it can be months before this happens. Take the situation in hand and make those plans. If you're single, consider making arrangements for a date or spending time with a friend.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|18|1|You may have a hard time relating to people in social situations, Aries. Perhaps you're frustrated at hearing the same shallow conversations over and over. While you mingle with dozens of different people, all you can think about is how nice it would be if you could be home in front of the TV. Your best plan is to avoid situations that you know you won't enjoy. There's no sense in torturing yourself.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|18|2|Things have probably been going well lately in the love and romance department, Taurus. You find that communication has improved, and the witty banter is invigorating and educational. Today there may be a blip on the radar. You may have been so caught up in the good parts that you failed to take care of the details and do the actual work needed to make things run smoothly.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|18|3|You may be feeling emotionally good, Gemini, but unfortunately the people around you don't seem to share this feeling. Your first instinct may be to sacrifice yourself in order to make the path easier for the next guy. Remember that other people need to learn how to do things on their own. If someone is in a bad mood, let them be in a bad mood. You may be better off spending the day alone.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|18|4|There's an advantage to joining people in a social or family situation, Cancer. Your role today is to bridge communication gaps. Be aware of details that need doing, but don't feel like you have to do them all yourself. This is a good time to delegate responsibility. Keep track of who is in charge of what or you could end up taking up the slack for a job that someone else is supposed to do.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|18|5|Calm down and get organized before you spread your ideas to others, Leo. This is especially true when it comes to love and romance. As soon as this topic comes up, you tense up and erupt inappropriately. Ground yourself and find your center of balance - literally and figuratively - before you proceed. Don't worry about getting the upper hand. What you need to do is join hands.|Aries|Sagittarius|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|18|6|You've reached a climactic time of year regarding love and romance, Virgo. This is the time when your dream finally materializes or you realize that all your efforts are failures. It all depends on how you played your cards over the past few months. This is one of those moments of reckoning when you face reality. You must bring your craft to the landing strip and check in with mission control.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|18|7|Your emotions are solid and you feel good, Libra. At the same time, you may be tongue-tied. You're having a hard time expressing your true feelings in the way you'd like to, especially when it comes to love and romance. Perhaps you have so many thoughts that you don't know how to sort them out, or which to disclose and which to keep hidden.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|18|8|Matters of love and romance should be going well, but try not to overdo it, Scorpio. Be careful of getting so caught up in the fantasy of romance that you fail to take care of the details. Today is a good day to get the foundation solid before you start building. If you've already started building, you may need to stand back and consider areas in which some extra support beams may be necessary.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|18|9|This is one of those days when the road forks in several directions and you must decide which way to go, Sagittarius. This usually isn't hard. You just go with the flow. But now things are flowing in multiple directions and you need to figure out which way to go. Stick with the way that seems most natural. Remember that whatever choice you make will be the right one.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|18|10|Your plane is fueled, your bags packed, and you have clearance from the control tower, but for some reason, Capricorn, you just can't seem to get off the ground. Perhaps there are details of the trip that you haven't taken into account. People are firing questions at you, and you don't have all the answers. This is especially true when it comes to matters of love and romance.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|18|11|The person who is most organized and stable will win the race, so let it be you, Aquarius. Be careful, though. Other people may try to distract you from your work. You may be in the middle of an important project and decide to take a break. Before you know it, the phone rings and suddenly you're trapped with no escape. The break that you hoped would take no more than five minutes has turned into a big interruption.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|18|12|Your brain is buzzing in high gear, Pisces. Anyone else would get dizzy trying to process even a fraction of the things that filter through your head in one day. The key for you is to not speak every single thought aloud but to keep your processing internal. People want to hear your final decision, not the process you went through to reach it. You will save everyone a lot of time if you do.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|19|1|This is the type of day you enjoy. The climate is positive and the energy is flowing. It's as though you have a magic wand. You give it a wave and - presto - the day's tasks and chores are done! By this evening, you've scarcely tapped your energy levels. Your family will be very happy to spend some quality time with you.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|19|2|If the world collapsed today, you wouldn't bat an eyelash. You're perfectly content sailing along on cloud nine! The source of your bliss could be that new person in your life. Are you passionately, intensely, wonderfully in love? You can yield to the magic. Let it bring out the positive parts of your personality, but keep your wits about you all the same!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|19|3|You may have had some emotional disappointments lately, but today will restore your faith in love. All you need to do is take action. Your amazing lucidity and realism keep you from hoping for the impossible. You'd rather go to work to attain your goals than dilly-dally with illusions. Indeed, you're more likely to get results from yourself than from other people.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|19|4|Put on your traveling shoes, Cancer. Fear of the unknown may have prompted you to postpone certain trips. You claimed you were too busy, but no one really believed this, not even you. If an opportunity to travel presents itself today, don't pass it up. It's silly to avoid life.|Pisces|Scorpio|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|19|5|Something is currently compelling you to be more of a world citizen than usual, Leo. You may find this somewhat disturbing. You feel as though the roots of your identity, such as your family background and social standing, are dissolving little by little. Comfort yourself with the knowledge that your family is simply changing and expanding. It will stabilize again on another, higher plane.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|19|6|Your surroundings are currently changing, Virgo. Perhaps your circle of friends has already undergone a major change. The fact is that you no longer have so many prejudices about the people you meet, and no longer seek only a certain type of person as a friend. You accept whoever comes along. You may not realize it, but your attitude is completely different now than it once was. Good for you!|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|19|7|"Libra, you're demystifying the concept of talent. You used to look enviously at other people and think, ""I wish I had a natural ability like that."" Now you understand that the person who aroused your envy with is just someone who had the self-confidence to go to work and refine and develop an aptitude. It's a matter of hard work, belief in oneself, and bravery in the face of risk. You can do it, too!
                
               "|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|19|8|Are you thinking of going into business for yourself, Scorpio? Being self-employed doesn't automatically mean you will have more freedom. Of course, you will be your own boss, but you will also bear all the responsibility for the success or failure of your enterprise. If you quit, the whole thing will collapse. Think about it. Base your decision on reality and not fantasy.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|19|9|Within the next few days, you're likely to gain access to dimensions of perception you never suspected, Sagittarius. Perhaps you will become aware of certain energy phenomena, peak experiences, or other highly sensitive states of consciousness. Don't be frightened. Instead, investigate what these worlds have to offer. What you learn will help you cope with your sensitivity.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|19|10|Often fiery temperaments like yours are drawn to fight for great causes despite the better judgment of more down-to-Earth people. As a result, you have great leadership potential that may emerge today. Your courage, enthusiasm, and vigor will be contagious when you climb onto your soapbox.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|19|11|Your optimism is likely to receive a little boost today, Aquarius. A memorable emotional encounter may be the source of some extra zeal. Or you may derive great satisfaction from being part of a group. The nagging chores of daily life will be forgotten for today at least. The outlook is nothing but positive!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|19|12|Perhaps you should suspend your inhibitions for the day, Pisces, and let your dreams guide you. For instance, you might imagine that the need to make any choices has vanished. Or you might grant yourself a vacation from daily chores. It would certainly be a relief. Who knows? You might conjure up some reality from the stuff of your dreams.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|1|Stop asking if you're gifted, Aries. This definitely isn't the time for such questions. Now is the time to work on something concrete. You will need the help of others if you're to succeed, so get to work convincing them to ally with you. You may have to reveal more of yourself than you normally do in order to sway people to your side. It's time to get out of your hole and take action!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|2|A partner for life or a brief encounter, which will it be? This is today's question. Why not choose both? Can you imagine being your partner's lover while keeping your independence? Don't be influenced by old models that force you to choose between these two ideas. Don't forget that in our modern world, your choices aren't as limited as you might think!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|20|3|You can never be anyone other than who you are, Gemini! That's the way it is and you can't change it. Other members of your family may have dreamed of getting free of a duty or a moral lesson, but these dreams don't apply to you. Your dreams of being someone else are like phantoms that have come back to haunt you. Simply brush them away!|Aquarius|Libra|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|4|The day ahead may bring a storm of individualism and independence. You usually tolerate the quirks and minor shortcomings of your friends or family members, but today they present real obstacles to your relationships. The only way to remedy the situation is to go on vacation. Spending some time alone will keep you out of trouble.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|20|5|If you want to make the best of the day ahead, Leo, try to convince your team or family to work together. This is tricky to do, what with everyone's schedule being so demanding right now. Hard as it is to coordinate their efforts and orchestrate harmony, the strength of your character and your team spirit will make it all work out.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|20|6|The day ahead won't be easy, Virgo. A glimpse at your love life reveals that you will be bridling at certain inhibitions. You long for peace and stability, and at the moment everything is in suspense. Use the day ahead to gain some perspective on the situation. Until the ice melts and the flow of events resumes, why not devote your energy to some other endeavor?|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|7|Lately, you've been nursing a feeling that your partner is inattentive. The tension has been building up and today, Libra, you're likely to boil over with the rage that comes from one too many doubts and suspicions. The forecast for love is stormy, without a doubt. But making up after the quarrel promises to be lots of fun.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|20|8|Some days it's better to be on vacation! That's what you're liable to think today. All your projects are mired in quicksand, and you feel like you're spinning your wheels. But even if things are momentarily stuck, don't lose faith. Your inner self is gaining stability. When the time is right, it will be strong and reliable.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|9|Deep inside, don't you have an urge to breathe new spirit into your love life? Of course, some things are more easily said than done. Currently, you don't have much time to devote to yourself, much less your partner. Affection could thrive if given half a chance. The day suggests that you commit yourself to making some decisions that will help bring you and your mate closer.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|20|10|"It's time to get what you need, Capricorn. Your desires don't always go in a direction that does you the most good, and this can cause tension. You feel as though it's impossible to combine your desires with what is good for you, notably in your love life. You wrestle with whether you should remain in your ""creative"" cave or share your life with someone. It doesn't have to be one or the other."|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|20|11|Take cover, Aquarius, because today promises to be an emotional roller coaster! Something seems to be askew with your relationships, and you feel torn in opposite directions. One force is pushing you to enrich your inner universe and another force is pushing you into the arms of someone you've recently met. Stay busy to avoid confrontation.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|20|12|People are going to think you're a star today, Pisces! Although you may not feel that way about yourself. What's gotten into you lately? Have you lost confidence in yourself? Are you now compensating for it? Do you feel a need for more success in your life? All this is possible, but you will have to take some risks if you're going to progress.|Scorpio|Cancer|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|1|Today, Aries, you're in the mood for commitment! Take time to connect with the social world as you seek like-minded people who can share your intimate, individualistic realm. Ultimately, we all have to figure out how to make our way in society. Today you will feel more sociable than usual. Expect to have some good ideas about ways you can enlarge your social circle.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|21|2|Your scattered energy comes together today in a powerful laser beam of concentrated attention and effort. You will work until you drop, and no one and nothing had better get in your way! Keep up the good pace. You're going to feel more loved than usual, and this changes absolutely everything for you.|Capricorn|Virgo|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|3|It seems that the new planetary lineup has just opened up some doors that had previously been shut. You revel in the confidence that people have in you. It isn't that your abilities have changed, just your attitude! People trust you because you exhibit more self-confidence. It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Hold on to it at all costs.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|21|4|There is a possibility that you feel cheated or taken advantage of in some way. Do you feel as if you're paying more than your fair share? The day ahead gives you an opportunity to achieve recognition for your efforts and perhaps redress some grievances. It's odd that despite your tendency to espouse fairness, you feel uncomfortable when the authorities rule in your favor.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|21|5|You're gifted at bringing people together, there's no doubt about that, Leo. Today will be especially good for participating in or initiating group activities. It's a favorable day for any project related to fellowship and assistance. You might do the groundwork to form a team, discussion group, or charitable endeavor.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|6|You have a promising day ahead, Virgo. Finally, you will advance by leaps and bounds in whatever needs to be done. Whatever has been causing the delays will likely be revealed today. You return to the skill and professionalism you so value after several weeks of halting progress. Don't tolerate any violation of your ethics now or in the future.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|21|7|There's some likelihood that something you need or want has been eluding your grasp. The somewhat strained aspect of the heavens lately hasn't helped. But today everything is within reach, especially if it was material considerations holding you back. You have an auspicious day ahead, so make the most of it!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|8|The day ahead will be a soothing one, Scorpio. Since it's auspicious for the material aspect of things, it's a good time to settle household issues like bills or repairs. But you might also take advantage of today's aspect to set in motion even more ambitious plans about your living situation. Is it time to think more seriously about that move you've been dreaming of?|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|21|9|You will be full of ideas for improving your lifestyle, Sagittarius, especially as it relates to your family. It's true that over the past few months you've experienced some hardships. You can breathe easier now. Whether it's for your career or home, today's initiatives are likely to bring great rewards. Take advantage of the atmosphere to put together a realistic plan for the future.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|21|10|Is discipline high on your list of priorities lately, Capricorn? You're undoubtedly trying to inject some order into your daily life, and your behavior could benefit from some adjustment as well. Whether it concerns food, hygiene, or simply the intensity of your daily rhythm, it's possible that you will notice a real improvement today.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|11|You can expect your mood to improve today, Aquarius. The professional and private projects that you have at the moment should be progressing well. You feel reassured, and you're encouraged to make some new plans. If you continue to keep up the good rhythm, you will have success in redefining your goals and life direction.|Libra|Gemini|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|21|12|Some people say that you miss out on life because of your tendency to observe your life rather than experience life directly. If that's the case, then today will be a real departure for you. You will suddenly seem more in contact with your sentiments and be more present and connected to those around you. It feels good for a change, doesn't it?|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|22|1|The possibility to advance your career through increasing your technological skills may present itself today. This could open doors for you in a lot of directions, paving the way for increased income. A number of new contacts could come into your life, bringing friendship and opportunities. This is the day to work on building your skills and possibly return to school.|Sagittarius|Leo|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|22|2|A number of social invitations could come your way today, possibly connected with groups you're affiliated with. Accept as many as you can handle, Taurus; you should have a wonderful time, learn much that fascinates you, and make some new friends. A surprise encounter with a friend or your romantic partner could bring you closer together. This may be a significant day for you.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|22|3|The latest equipment might suddenly be available to you. It's likely to make life easier and more interesting. It could also open doors to make new friends and find new opportunities. Increased income is also a possibility. You could stumble on some surprising information, Gemini, and this could set your mind going in a new direction. Today promises a lot of stimulation.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|22|4|Friends or a group could bring new and exciting information your way, perhaps involving career or educational opportunities. You might explore combining artistic talents with modern technology. Invitations to related social events could follow. Accept as many as you can, Cancer. They could make a difference in your personal, professional, and creative lives.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|22|5|Today you could decide to host a party or meeting in your home. You're likely to expect a lot of visitors. This should be an exciting occasion, Leo, and you could go out of your way to make this the best event possible. It will probably be worth it. This event could bring people and information your way that make a big difference to you.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|22|6|Vast amounts of information could come to you through email or phone. Expect to hear from groups. You could make new friends, Virgo, possibly in your neighborhood, as changes could be taking place in your community. You could hear of classes you want to take. Books or magazines may bring valuable information. This could be a very stimulating and significant day.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|22|7|Have you been thinking about expanding your computer skills? If so, this is the day to do it. You're likely to discover a lot of valuable information, as well as shortcuts for accomplishing your goals. Happiness reigns in the home as family members exchange a lot of new and interesting ideas. This could be a very gratifying day in a lot of ways, Libra.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|22|8|Social events, possibly involving groups, could put you in touch with knowledgeable people who could provide valuable information. You might decide to go back to school or otherwise advance your education. Technology could play a large part in all this, Scorpio, so it might be a good idea to work on your computer skills and bring them up to snuff. A short trip by air could be in the offing.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|22|9|Today your mind might be on social and political issues. If you aren't currently involved with groups dealing with these issues, you might consider joining one. A recent increase in income might have given you some extra time, and you may be excited about the possibilities. Service to others is one, Sagittarius. Consider some others, perhaps developing a creative skill, before moving ahead.|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|22|10|Information could come your way today that starts you thinking about new and revolutionary ideas. Perhaps they involve modern technology or social and political issues.

This promises to be a busy, stimulating day.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|23|1|Are you feeling scattered, Aries? It's possible that you're wondering about a million different things today. Are you strong enough to assume your family duties? Are you attractive? Are you important? Of course, all these questions simply distract you from your anxiety. Don't worry. The next few weeks will be less stressful.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|23|2|Perhaps you notice some weariness today, Taurus. You have been much more active than usual for the past few weeks. You've been meeting new people, having new experiences, attending meetings, and perhaps even taking short trips. In the long run, will any of it further your goals? That's the question you have to answer today.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|23|3|Are you tired, Gemini? It's no wonder. You're so eager to be useful that you've run yourself ragged over the past few weeks. As you may have noticed, the world is so apathetic now that every movement requires enormous effort on your part. Why not settle down and rest today? That would be the wisest and most reasonable thing to do. You will still be needed tomorrow.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|23|4|"The planets are moving you into a new cycle, Cancer. Soon you will be in a new ""story."" You will have to take stock of what you've learned in previous weeks. Who you are is related to the degree of peace you have in your life and whether or not you've been able to resolve some conflicts. Did you learn your lessons well? Without a doubt, you have a gift for calming tense situations.
                
             "|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|23|5|Have you done the cleaning that the planetary configurations asked you to do in recent weeks, Leo? If this is the case, today you should start to feel less weighed down by the conventions in your life. You've undoubtedly solved some of the problems in your relationships. You will feel as if you're in a kind of renaissance through the next cycle.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|23|6|The social agitation that has been in your life for the last three weeks is coming to an end, Virgo. The celestial energy will help you learn some lessons and prepare for the next cycle. It would be great if you had some success and honors, because this would help you confront the coming weeks. It will be a time of meditation and feeling a little bit disconnected from the world.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|23|7|"This is the end of the first stage in your ""socialization,"" Libra. Are you satisfied with the people you've met? You can usually make the most out of these encounters, but did your political savvy let you down? Did it lead you in directions you didn't want to go? Take advantage of this pause to catch your breath and figure out where you are today and where you want to be tomorrow.
                
               "|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|23|8|This is the end of the voyage you've been on over the past few weeks, Scorpio. You undoubtedly saw some interesting sights. Whether you were on an inner or outer voyage, the cosmic energy will bring you to a safe harbor. Unpack your bags carefully, as they're filled with treasures and souvenirs. You will want to put them around the house as happy reminders of how much you've grown.|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|23|9|After the events of the last few weeks, do you still want to continue acting like the same person? This is always a good question to ask with a celestial atmosphere like today's. People generally feel that they have a chance to get out of old systems and relationships. But people always hesitate to do this because of a fear of the future. Don't waver. Take the next steps!|Leo|Aries|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|23|10|The day ahead should give you an opportunity to analyze the events of the past three weeks, Capricorn. You will draw many important conclusions about your love life. You may conclude that matters have evolved little, if at all. This is discouraging, to be sure, but don't place too much trust in appearances. Remember, things aren't always as they seem.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|23|11|If you feel as though you aren't making sufficient progress toward your goals, use this day to correct your aim. Are you disappointed with your love life? You may have devoted a great deal of energy to it lately without seeing much payoff. Wait a few more days before you make any drastic decisions about the future, Aquarius.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|23|12|Are you feeling somewhat annoyed today? This is hardly surprising since the day inspires you to take a long, hard look at what's happening with your life. It's as though you suddenly realize that decisions you make may have impacts that reach far and wide. But don't let that stop you from committing yourself to a course of action, Pisces. Be adventurous!|Sagittarius|Cancer|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|24|1|It could be that close friends or family members are in sharp disagreement regarding a certain issue, Aries. Try not to be too distressed by divisions among the people you love. Some may want you to take sides and express yourself fully on the situation. You may feel as if you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Try your best to compromise.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|24|2|There is a great deal of emotion and drive to the day, just the way you like it, Taurus. Make sure you don't get stuck with the short end of the stick as the day comes to a close. An honest fight or debate is one thing, but a harsh manipulation of people is another. Make sure you're involved in the former and not the latter.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|24|3|You're going to be a valuable asset to others today because of your rational mind and ability to think things through clearly. The stubborn forces around you aren't going to bend, but you have the unique ability to do so. Do your best to avoid fights, even though it will be tempting for you and others to want to let off some steam.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|24|4|In your attempts to always be the nice, helpful one, Cancer, you might find that you're compromising some of your values. Know that balance and harmony are wonderful things, but they aren't always worth the price of self-sacrifice. Don't be someone you aren't just to maintain the peace. Your tolerance is apt to be tested today. Don't feel bad if you suddenly feel like fighting.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|24|5|Actions could be quick and intense today, Leo. Things may hit you like lightning, so be prepared for just about anything. Mentally stabilize yourself before interacting with others. Dress to demonstrate your power. You're a force to be reckoned with, not one to be stepped on. Violent emotions are apt to emerge. Don't fight the urge to release any anger you feel. Direct it appropriately.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|24|6|Your playful attitude is apt to be opposed by someone who refuses to see things your way, Virgo. Walk away from those who aren't committed to helping the situation. It could be that there are people who purposefully try to sabotage your plans. You're too smart to fall into this trap. Prove to others that even though you may be happy, it doesn't mean you're gullible.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|24|7|Today may be one of those days in which you're trying to paint a large area, but you only have a small brush. Your strokes are careful and calculated. You're doing a neat and precise job, but you're also doing things the hard way. Go easy on yourself and get a large brush. Make your strokes gigantic so you can cover more area with less effort.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|24|8|You may be barking up the wrong tree today, Scorpio. Before you waste all your energy on your podium proclaiming your thoughts to the world, it would behoove you to stop, look around, and notice your audience. How are they reacting to your tirade? Are people walking away or are they cheering? Perhaps you need to let someone else have a turn at the microphone.|Cancer|Pisces|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|24|9|In an attempt to merge with infinity, you might overlook some basic life principles, Sagittarius. Be careful about being seduced by those who want you to be involved in their drama. You might willingly acquiesce at first. You may not even realize how deep a hole you've dug until it's too late. Make sure you haven't alienated everyone so that there's still someone left to dig you out.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|24|10|Feel free to stand up for yourself, a cause, or another person today, even if you know it will cause tension among the others around you. A heated argument is likely to ensue, and it wouldn't be surprising if you were the catalyst. Passionate debates are right up your alley, so use this as an opportunity to demonstrate your courage and strength in what you believe.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|24|11|Your mind is apt to be fixed on one thing today, Aquarius, and you won't rest until you've obtained it. Perhaps it's a physical place you're trying to get to, a new gadget that you want to own, or a person you'd like to go out with. Don't be surprised if you have to put up a bit of a fight in order to accomplish this goal, whatever it may be.|Scorpio|Gemini|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|24|12|Things may happen right under your nose today, Pisces, and you may not even be aware of it. The thing that will be obvious is your reaction to the situation when this hidden event suddenly comes to light. A passionate explosion is likely, due to people's heightened emotional state. Try to work with this energy instead of against it.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|25|1|Group functions and social events might not prove as satisfying as usual today, Aries. You may not be in the mood. You might feel pressured to mingle when you'd rather sit on the couch. Whatever conversations you get into will seem trivial and boring. This is a good day to sit back and listen. You might learn from the people around you without having to say a word.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|25|2|Pride might get in your way today, Taurus. Perhaps you will be asked to do a task that you consider beneath you. Perhaps the people around you are feeling persnickety. Rise above the insults and make a special effort to do the best you can, defusing the situation before it gets out of hand. Tonight enjoy an evening at a concert or the theater.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|25|3|Your imagination might conjure stories or pictures that you want to memorialize through writing or painting, but a lack of self-confidence might discourage you. However, it's probably a good idea to do it anyway. These ideas come from deep inside you. Giving them shape could represent a release from old traumas. Keep your work hidden in a drawer if you don't like it.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|25|4|Attendance at some kind of group event might seem especially appealing today. However, Cancer, worries about your family might distract you so that you don't benefit from it the way you should. You also might find some of the conversation boring. Despite your lack of enthusiasm, it might be a good idea to get out anyway. Staying home alone could make for a gloomy evening.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|25|5|Let's face it, Leo. Today you're likely to find your chores and errands exceedingly boring. You could find yourself watching the clock, feeling like an hour has gone by and then realizing it's only been ten minutes. If you can put off your tasks until tomorrow, by all means do so. Nothing is so urgent that it requires your undivided attention all day. Treat yourself to a fun afternoon.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|25|6|You might be distracted by daydreams of a trip you're planning to take, Virgo. A friend could phone and want to discuss it, which doesn't help. Visions of faraway places and exciting pastimes may dance in your head, and routine tasks seem incredibly tedious and unworthy of attention. It's best to get them done if you can. Then you can fantasize about your vacation without guilt!|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|25|7|You might not have heard from a close friend in a long time and worry a little, Libra. Perhaps this person wasn't well the last time you talked. If you can, it might be a good idea to call. Strange and unsettling dreams could plague your sleep tonight, but don't get too agitated. They aren't prophetic in any way. The symbols probably represent nothing more than psychic detritus released through sleep.|Gemini|Aquarius|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|25|8|An older visitor might come to your door today, Scorpio. You aren't likely to be too thrilled about this, but you will be able to play the good host anyway. Romance and sociability may be a bit limited by obligations to family, particularly parents, but don't let it get you down. You may be stuck at home tonight, but you will be able to let loose later.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|25|9|Mundane tasks, including errands and answering correspondence, might bore you all day, Sagittarius. You're likely to be restless and strongly tempted to chuck it all and go somewhere to enjoy yourself. Take a good look at what you're doing and try to judge objectively how important it is to get it done now. If it isn't that important, then put it aside. You probably need to relax!|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|25|10|Financial issues may interfere with your self-expression today, Capricorn. Perhaps you need a little more money before proceeding with a project that means a lot to you. You usually aren't one to let this kind of consideration stop you, though. Just a little bit of thought and planning could make whatever it is you want to do more feasible than it appears to be. Write down some ideas and go to it!|Libra|Taurus|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|25|11|A charismatic person might visit you today and want your help with something. Emotional issues regarding family might have you feeling gloomy. Your creative side may have to lie fallow while you attend to mundane issues. Basically, you feel pretty optimistic about your life and future. You're never afraid of hard work, and you're persevering. Go for what you want and make everyone happy, including you!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|25|12|Worries about relatives or friends could plague you throughout the day, Pisces. Perhaps you aren't sure what's wrong and so you feel helpless. Whatever vague worries you may have, don't try to figure out the truth without knowing the facts. You could make mountains out of molehills. This isn't a good day to run errands. Delays and obstacles could cause a lot of frustration and wasted time.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|26|1|Guard your heart today, Aries, for it's a prime target of the abrasive words flying around. Your sensitive nature feels alone and vulnerable in this harsh atmosphere, so you might be better off just staying in bed. If you decide to go out, make sure to bring your arsenal. Use your sensitivity to your advantage. Scope out your weaknesses so you're able to use your energy most efficiently.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|26|2|We need to have more people like you in places of power, Taurus. And don't feel like it's out of the question. Today's astrological weather is helping you find the confidence and physical strength you need to boost your leadership abilities. This is the time to take control of the situation. You can do it!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|26|3|Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Gemini. The problem with the energy today is that there may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such objects. There are powerful forces operating that are charged with emotional aggression. War may break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|26|4|Emotionally, things might get rather tense for you as others tend to demonstrate a selfish attitude, Cancer. Selfishness doesn't always have to be considered a negative. Sometimes it's healthy and necessary to take a more self-centered stance. You need to take care of yourself at all times. So don't try to pick a fight when other people also demonstrate this behavior.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|26|5|You might be stirred by the energy present in the air today, Leo. Put on your armor and get ready to do battle. Others may cower when they look out their window and see what's going on outside, but you want to jump into the fray. Strong, aggressive emotions are the weapons of the day, and everybody knows that you have quite an arsenal in this department.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|26|6|Move in for the touchdown today, Virgo, and don't stop until you succeed. Don't let other people's insecurities become yours. Have confidence in yourself and the way you behave around others. Just because someone else feels sad doesn't mean you have to, just to make them feel better. The best thing you can do in this situation is turn it around by exhibiting sheer happiness.|Taurus|Capricorn|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|26|7|Now is the perfect time to say something to someone that you've been meaning to say for quite some time, Libra. Get it out in the open. Keeping it inside will only eat away at you. Stop worrying about the consequences and make the move. Today is the time to be bold and aggressive. Other people might respond in a similar fashion, so if you dish it out, be prepared to take it.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|26|8|Your opinions might be the topic of conversation all day, Scorpio. You have a very strong will and you aren't afraid to express it. Today you will get that chance. Feel free to enlighten others with your tremendous wealth of knowledge. Take control of the conversation and accept the mental challenge of trying to win other people over to your side. Whether you're successful or not, you will have fun trying.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|26|9|Your sensitive heart may be sparked by anger today, Sagittarius. Don't be afraid of hurting other people's feelings. You'd be doing yourself and others a disservice by not revealing the true scope of your emotions. The other parties involved may not have all the facts necessary to make the most educated decision. Aid in this process by revealing your perspective.|Virgo|Aries|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|26|10|You might feel a great deal of physical power on a day like today, Capricorn. If someone asks you to come help move a couch, you're likely to be able to pick up the whole thing by yourself. Don't sell yourself short. You have more internal strength than you reveal to others. There's no need to hide it any longer. Feel free to make use of this great power you possess.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|26|11|The ship is headed out, so you'd better hop on board, Aquarius. People aren't apt to be too sympathetic to your emotional sob story today, so keep it under wraps. Whining will get you kicked off the boat altogether. Today's energy is teaching you to toughen up. Don't take it personally. Realize that there are important lessons we all need to learn. One of them is to know when to be silent.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|26|12|You'll want to jump into action today, Pisces. Feel free to order others around for a change and delegate. An aggressive approach is exactly what's called for, and you have the ability to deliver the goods. Trying to do everything yourself may seem like a great idea at first, but you're better off enlisting help so others can feel involved and you can concentrate on doing a better job on fewer tasks.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|27|1|This is a confusing period for all of us, Aries. But no doubt you've noticed this. In such circumstances, some people become more rigid than ever because they resist dramatic change. They try to hold on to tradition. Your Aries sensitivity makes you very receptive to the past, but current conditions should inspire you to let go of some of your convictions.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|27|2|What do you have to lose, Taurus? The planets are shaking you in the hopes of ridding you of your old objectives to make way for new growth. You feel doubt where once there was only certainty. When you consider the worst that can happen, it may help you to realize that what you're clinging to really isn't all that important. It's time to let go and begin anew.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|27|3|You aren't the only one who can solve your problems, Gemini. Trust that there are others who are capable of understanding. Those who want to help you are motivated only by love, with no ulterior motives. It's in your nature to be skeptical, but these people do exist. And guess what? You could meet one of them today!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|27|4|Have you noticed how delays seem to occur more often, Cancer? Today will be no exception. Something you've been waiting for has been delayed yet again. It may be that the order form got lost or that there was some unforeseeable delay in sending it to you. Even with your mild-mannered Cancer temperament, you're beginning to be a little irked! Sit tight. All will be resolved shortly.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|27|5|Get outside and get moving, Leo! If you can manage to take the day off, this would be a good time to release some energy. You used to enjoy competition when you were little. Remember how exhilarating it was to be the first to the top of the hill? You will find your life greatly enriched if you can find a way to rekindle similar feelings.|Aries|Sagittarius|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|27|6|Devote the day to your children or partner, Virgo. You may protest that it's too hard to find the time to give them the attention they deserve. You don't have time for yourself, much less anyone else. In any case, you will probably feel torn between what is expected of you and what you feel you can realistically give. If you want to dispel the inner tension, take care in the choices you make in the next few weeks.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|27|7|A friend or family member is slowly poisoning your relationship, Libra. A misunderstanding between the two of you will ultimately prove beneficial in the long run. Why? It makes you realize how uncomfortable you are with vague, ill-defined relationships. Today would be a good day to write a letter to the person in question. You're likely to find the results gratifying.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|27|8|You've been a social butterfly lately, Scorpio! The sociable phase you're currently in demands a great deal of energy. You're attracted to some of your new acquaintances but irritated by others. One in particular causes you real anxiety today. You have two choices. Either abandon your new group of friends entirely, or expel the person who's causing you trouble.|Leo|Pisces|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|27|9|Your thin skin feels even thinner than usual today, Sagittarius. If you happen to witness a violent outburst in the street, at work, or on television, you suddenly become aware of your vulnerability. Don't let it frighten you into hiding. As one of the few remaining guardians of the world's dwindling reserves of kindness, you have a responsibility.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|27|10|People sometimes say that you're a little aggressive in your approach, Capricorn. But today you feel a little tired of leading the charge on the battlefield. You can learn a lot from your friends who can teach you to think of things in relative terms without allowing yourself to become emotionally involved in every situation. Try to relax for a change!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|27|11|You may be a bit oversensitive today, Aquarius. It's possible that you will be irritable and conflicted as you begin to suspect that long-term projects may not be finished. The time has come to take stock. There is likely a good reason that you've been unable to complete that project you undertook several months ago. Advice from others should steer you in the right direction.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|27|12|There's no point in trying to make sense of today, Pisces. Much of what happens occurs on an unconscious level and defies any rational explanation. You may have had a dream last night worthy of professional interpretation. If you can bear turning off your intellect, this could be a very profitable day for you.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|1|Your passions have been stirring like a caged animal for the past several days, Aries. Now is the time to let them out. Some of what you express may elicit surprise or disapproval, but that's no reason to stay silent. If you don't express yourself, illness may result. Your goal should be to be true to your inner self. Ultimately, that's the only way to be happy and healthy.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|2|What an odd day, Taurus! You feel like you've been given a one-way ticket to a faraway place. Departure is imminent, leaving you no time to pack or say goodbye. There isn't a moment to waste. You're intrigued by the adventure, yet afraid to go. All signs indicate that it will be beneficial if you get on that plane. Send your loved ones a postcard once you get to your destination.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|3|When the day is done, you will look back on it as an unusual one, Gemini. Wild ideas sprouted in your head like mushrooms. You may have imagined leaving immediately for a trip around the world, or drawn up plans for a housekeeping invention, or visualized an entirely new opening in the online world. Don't dismiss these ideas as unrealistic. They are not.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|28|4|There's likely to be some tumult in your emotional life right now, Cancer. You may feel a pressing need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your partner. Tension may develop if you become increasingly insistent about your need to do so. Anger or alienation can be avoided if you express your feelings with clarity and compassion.|Pisces|Scorpio|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|28|5|Friends and family, while dear, can be irritating today, Leo. Everyone around you seems upset and unable to communicate clearly. Fortunately, your temper has a long fuse. To avoid a sudden explosion, it would be a good idea to avoid home and the tensions there. If you take a break from your normal routine, you're likely to meet people who will put you in a calmer frame of mind.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|28|6|All dissatisfaction will be abolished today as you systematically confront and resolve all the little problems that have been bothering you. Your tolerance threshold is low to nonexistent. Give a wide berth to friends who have been irritating lately. Your wardrobe improves dramatically as you discard all those clothes that don't fit or no longer suit you.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|7|You're rarely surprised or bothered by the occasional setback. Today, however, you should put a firm hand on any project you undertake. This isn't the time for a relaxed attitude, especially where money is concerned. If you take a systematic approach, you will have the double benefit of conserving both energy and assets.|Cancer|Aquarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|8|Expect to be torn between two seemingly paradoxical urges today, Scorpio. Part of you wants to spend the day wrapped in a cocoon, playing with your toys. But another side of you is just as committed to spearheading a major creative or social endeavor with friends who share your revolutionary ideas. You feel exhausted from trying to build the perfect world.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|28|9|"You're often called the ""cleanup crew."" Whether it's the home or the unconscious, you enjoy preparing nests for all sorts of births, real and figurative. Don't be surprised if you find yourself tidying up your home, throwing away useless things, clearing the desk, or catching up on mail. There are powerful forces compelling you to prepare for someone or something new and different.
                
             "|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|28|10|Act without hesitation today, Capricorn, especially if you're following unfamiliar directions or exploring new territory. This may not seem like the best advice, but this is a day for saying an unflinching yes to all manner of proposals that come your way, even if some are unclear. Capricorn excels at this type of test. Expect to be at the head of the class by the end of the day!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|28|11|You're obviously struggling with something big, Aquarius. Recent comments about your irritability are well founded. But don't worry. They'll forgive you eventually. In the meantime, do what you can to control your temper. It stems from your current fears, which seem to be multiplying exponentially. Blame the situation on the planets and accept it as a lesson on the path to self-realization.|Scorpio|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|28|12|Expect to be in a provocative mood today, Pisces. For the past few days you may have been searching for an outlet for the overflowing energy you're so lucky to have. You will have an opportunity today, as innovative projects are likely to come your way. If you face your demons, you will find a unique opportunity to rid yourself of the fears you've been carrying around for so long.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|1|There may be a bit of aggravation in a part of your life that's urging you to get up and do something, Aries. It could be that you're getting overly emotional about a certain issue, and that you need to consider more of the cold, hard facts of what's really going on. You could be missing something obvious simply because you're so caught up in your emotional drama.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|2|You may feel a bit stodgy today, Taurus, but things are going to pick up tonight. There will be a great deal of air to fuel your fire, and you're ready to burn! You could be like a desert of dry sagebrush just ready to be set alight. The whole mountainside is about to go up in a beautiful blaze of glory. You're ready to shine like the brilliant star that you are.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|29|3|Get things taken care of in the morning so you can be carefree and laid back in the evening. It's important for you to square things away in your head so you can communicate important information to others later. Feel free to take an unconventional approach. It's important to march to the beat of your own drum and not anyone else's.|Aquarius|Libra|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|29|4|Your usual lazy attitude is apt to receive a burst of energy tonight, Cancer. It's in your nature not to want to lift a finger, but for some reason you may be compelled to get up and get moving. You will find that when you connect with others, you're more motivated to make things happen for yourself. When you get the attention you feel you deserve, your devotion is strong.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|29|5|You may find your emotions difficult to deal with, Leo, especially later in the day. Consider taking an intellectual instead of emotional approach. Your feelings could send you into a drastic mood swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. The thing you really need right now - especially tonight - is balance. Tie up any loose ends to maintain more equilibrium.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|6|Communication with others could be extremely rewarding, Virgo, especially later in the day. Project more of your energy outward and join others in projects that you might otherwise try to tackle on your own. Things should flow smoothly as long as you take a lighthearted, optimistic approach. Move forward with projects instead of just contemplating their completion.|Gemini|Capricorn|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|7|Make sure you solidify your affairs early in the day, Libra, because the sparks are going to fly after sunset. People might try to throw you off balance with fast talk and fancy ideas. You need to make sure you're on solid ground before you take the next step upward. Balance your emotions so you don't take your frustration out on others. Focus on your goals.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|29|8|Things are looking up for you, Scorpio, especially later in the day. Pieces should be coming together and things flowing into place naturally. You will find that your outward-directed energy is better balanced now. You should connect with others using your keen wit, strong will, and sheer intelligence. Take your time to do the things you need to do. Don't rush.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|29|9|The energy is apt to pick up in your life today, Sagittarius. You may be asked to report to duty. Don't make promises you can't keep. Your words will be taken seriously, and you shouldn't mislead people into thinking that something is going to happen when you know it isn't. You know how that situation will turn out. Trust yourself, regardless of the circumstances.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|29|10|There's extra aggression in your world today, Capricorn. Realize that this is probably due more to your reaction to a situation than to the situation itself. It could be that you're in conflict with someone just because he or she wants harmony while you have a propensity to fight. This paradox is likely to be detrimental to your psyche unless you make an effort to change it.|Libra|Aries|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|11|Your mood may take a bizarre twist today, Aquarius, as you calm your desire to fight for something. You're probably more interested in enjoying the beauty of something rather than trying to keep it for yourself. Allowing someone or something else to be free is the best gift you can give. Keep the lines of communication open and you will find that everything falls into place as it should.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|29|12|Things are going to get better and better for you as the day progresses, Pisces. Try to get your grounded, practical, and logical self collected during the day so you have the evening to socialize and commune with close friends. Balance is going to be a key issue for you today, so make sure you keep things in check before any one part of your life gets out of hand.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|1|Have sympathy for those who need to vent today, Aries. Don't be surprised if people line up outside your door for a chance to bend your ear for an hour or two. Your mind is sharp. You will be able to see to the core of any issue brought before you. More than likely, you will understand things intuitively. People will do well to take your advice on any issue they have.|Capricorn|Gemini|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|11|30|2|You will probably want everyone to know how you feel today, Taurus. You won't be shy about expressing your emotions. Feel free to take the lead on matters, for you have the self-confidence and emotional stability to do quite well at the helm of the ship. Try not to let your mind trip over itself, however. You have the tendency to think about one issue so much that you completely lose perspective.|Capricorn|Virgo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|11|30|3|Put your foot down today, Gemini. Don't let others push you around. It could be that you're used to letting people have their way in order to keep the peace. The problem with this is that your dreams and goals may get lost in the shuffle. Don't lose sight of your true destination. There's much more to life than you might see on the surface. Dig deeper.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|11|30|4|For goodness' sake, make a decision today, Cancer. The more you flounder about which way to go, the likelier it is that you will miss the boat altogether. You have all the facts you need, so don't delay any longer. Once you make up your mind, be strong and throw all your weight behind it. Your mind can be like a computer filing away information as long as you stay alert.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|5|Mentally, you're apt to do very well today, Leo. You will find that you can tackle just about any cerebral challenge that comes along. The most difficult aspect of the day will be dealing with your emotions. More than likely, you will feel a great desire for attention. You just want to be loved. Get up on stage and say what's in your heart. This isn't a good time to harbor your feelings.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|6|Your heart is in the right place today, Virgo, so feel free to share your good mood with others. Keep things simple and straightforward. Try not to complicate issues with unnecessary garble. Streamline your thoughts and actions. You will find that you can be much more efficient when you cut out the aspects that aren't pertinent or absolutely necessary. Follow your heart.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|11|30|7|You may find it hard to get rolling today, Libra. It's likely that you're caught in a gridlock between your mind and heart. Be careful about letting this tension build. The most important thing for you today is to relax. Tackle things one step at a time and finish one project before starting another. You could get overwhelmed if you have too many things on your plate at once.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|30|8|You're apt to be spurred into action by strong forces that don't want you to take a break, Scorpio. Keep in mind that the more you resist, the more you will be pushed and pulled by outside sources. If you find yourself in a bind, take a deep breath and calm down. Act from a point of neutrality instead of a point of anger or defensiveness.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|11|30|9|Feel free to let it all out today, Sagittarius. It's finally your turn to stand up and say what you feel. Don't let others push you into places you don't want to be. The key is to probe deeply with your penetrating mind and share your incredible insights with others. Don't be surprised if your actions cause some tension. Don't let this stop you from doing what you feel is right.|Virgo|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|10|Emotionally speaking, you're probably doing quite well today, Capricorn. You have extra self-confidence to draw on to tackle your projects. The one difficult aspect of the day probably has to do with some sort of mental challenge that for some reason just isn't making sense. Don't continue to beat a dead horse. If things don't want to budge, let them sit. Tackle them later.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|11|You might be in a bit of a jam today, Aquarius, when one person or situation doesn't work well with what you're thinking, and another doesn't fit well with what you're feeling. There's a clash taking place that may be difficult to reconcile, especially if you remain stubbornly in your position. The more flexible you are, the better off you will be.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|11|30|12|Today is a good day for you to follow through, Pisces. Normally you're much better at tagging along or simply going with the flow of the situation. This way of doing things has proven quite effective for you in the past. Indeed, it has gotten you far. What you have now is a different situation. The things you've started will do you no good until you complete them.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|1|1|Finally, you're on the mend, Aries. The minor ailments that have been dragging you down lately are beginning to disappear, and you're about to regain all of your physical energy. However, if you overindulge, your energy levels are likely to plummet again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!|Sagittarius|Leo|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|1|2|Do you feel a little under the weather, Taurus? It's possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from those storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down but rather your worries about the future that drain your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|1|3|There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension, Gemini. Did you dare to express some contrary intellectual opinion? In any case, it looks like your self-confidence is stronger than usual right now. Go ahead and express any complaints or opinions you may have been keeping to yourself. But try and do it gently, especially where your family is concerned.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|1|4|It would seem that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Cancer. You continue to go through the motions and do what you planned to do, but it seems like your heart isn't in it anymore. Don't ask yourself why. It's just that you've worked hard and have been thinking hard lately. You have reached your limit and it's time for you to rest.|Aries|Scorpio|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|1|5|You may have been spending or saving too much money, Leo. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than eternal frustration. It's a curious phenomenon. It's as though you have lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|1|6|You've been stamping the ground impatiently. You're waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures with renewed vigor after your meditation of the last few months. Virgo, know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains. Gather your strength and get ready for action!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|1|7|If you find yourself tired and irritable now, Libra, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few months that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue with the same rhythm? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to physical exhaustion. If you get sick, you will be even more frustrated. So be wise and take care of your own basic needs.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|1|8|This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Scorpio. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked on a painting for too long, which is take a step back. You need to see some people, travel, go to the theater, and clear your head. This is never easy for you, but don't hesitate. You will realize afterward that it was the best thing for you to do.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|1|9|This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Sagittarius. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|1|10|You took off like a bullet a few days ago, Capricorn, making great progress in a short amount of time. But now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up! Just rethink your strategy.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|1|11|There is some likelihood that thoughts of your love life will haunt you today, Aquarius. Perhaps you're intrigued by the idea of exploring certain realms of your relationship that remain secret, but you're unsure how to communicate this to your mate. Perhaps you're still testing the waters, waiting until you're sure of how you feel. In any case, you may make a decision to proceed!|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|1|12|Today more than ever you will yearn to escape from the daily routine. You're thirsty for new sights and sounds, new faces and places. However, you're well aware that you must juggle your desires with your professional or domestic obligations. It isn't always easy, but you should trust your imagination to suggest a way to amicably settle this conflict.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|2|1|An electrifying attraction to someone you may have just met could cause your mind to dwell on sex and romance today, Aries. If you can, set up a romantic evening with a love partner. If this isn't possible, go to an emotional play or movie that moves you to tears. Movies may be of particular interest to you today, since you might be reading about how they're made.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|2|2|Family members could be upset over different frustrating events in their lives, and these moods could spill over to you. Today it would be best to leave them alone to work things out in their own way. They aren't likely to respond to sympathy. Take this opportunity to tend to some of your concerns that you may have postponed. This way, the silence in the house can work for you.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|2|3|Unguarded words on the part of a younger person might lead to upset. If the words are directed at you, don't take them seriously. The person doesn't know any better. If the words are directed at someone else, don't be tempted to lash out at the person who said them. Correct him or her gently. Either way, keep it to yourself and then forget it. It isn't worth the stress.|Pisces|Libra|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|2|4|Profligate spending over the past week or two may have you feeling less confident about your money situation today, Cancer. Perhaps you've lent some money to a friend and you doubt their ability to repay. Or maybe you fell for a sales pitch that you now regret. Correct the situation if you can. If you can't, simply learn from the experience and put it behind you.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|2|5|Your ambition and will to succeed may be at war with your feelings today, Leo. Perhaps you've been working so hard that you aren't spending enough time with friends and family - and they miss you. Children and young people may be very much on your mind. Perhaps you doubt your ability to fulfill your responsibilities. Be objective when considering the situation. Don't let your emotions run away with you.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|2|6|Today, Virgo, you might uncharacteristically decide to sequester yourself away from the world. Perhaps you're tired or feeling a bit under the weather and only wish to kick back and read a good book. That's fine. Everyone needs a little solitude from time to time. The only concern here is that if you stay too secluded, you might miss an important communication. Resist the temptation to turn off the phone!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|2|7|A quarrel over money could interfere with a friendship today, Libra. Perhaps someone hasn't repaid a loan and the lender now needs it. Perhaps a member of your household is unable to pay their share of the bills. Don't let yourself get drawn into quarrels or recriminations. Work something out with your friend if possible. Money isn't worth throwing away a friendship and leaving a gap in your life.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|2|8|Spiritual and metaphysical studies may take up a lot of your time today, Scorpio. You might want to dig into the world's major religions or try to make it through works about spiritualism or the occult. If you want to, this is the day to do it because your concentration is very strong, although it will be necessary to take a lot of breaks!|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|2|9|You might long for a vacation today, Sagittarius, and you could toy with the idea of a journey by air. Your mind may turn to spiritual places such as India, Egypt, Israel, or Ireland as you wonder how it would feel to stand in the sacred places in those countries. Don't just toy with the idea. You're probably overdue for a vacation, and such a trip would suit your mystical nature.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|2|10|Someone you've known for a long time may move away or otherwise vanish from your life. He or she may move to a distant state. You'll probably stay in touch by phone or email, but it will never be the same, at least not for a long time. You will feel better if you meet some new people. They will come your way today, possibly through humanitarian group activities.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|2|11|There might be some tension between you and your romantic partner that might have you feeling a bit depressed. The key to patching this up is honest communication. Remember that honest doesn't necessarily mean brutal. Confrontations now can only widen the rift. Tell your partner how you feel, Aquarius, but don't cast blame for anything. Share a little. By day's end, all should be well.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|2|12|Today your biorhythms may be a little low, Pisces, so you aren't likely to be feeling very sociable. You're more likely to want to bury your nose in your projects instead of being your usual outgoing self. This is OK, but take care that you aren't so reclusive that you miss receiving some sincere compliments. That can make a big difference in the way you feel!|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|3|1|You may find that you're taking a much more daring approach when it comes to love and romance now, Aries. If you aren't, than maybe you should. You will never know the possibilities until you at least give it a try. You may find that there's something spurring you on today. Use that impulse to initiate a new path toward the object of your desire.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|3|2|Things should go well for you today, Taurus, especially in the love and romance department. Don't shy away from the obvious attraction that you have toward one special person. Today is the day to amplify that feeling instead of hide from it. Show off your love with the brightest, boldest colors and actions possible. There is magic in the attention that you give and receive.|Aquarius|Virgo|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|3|3|There may be too much fiery energy in the day to make you feel comfortable with the situation, Gemini. Instead of trying to resist this powerful force, it would be better if you embraced it. Use this day to draw out some of your inner flame and let it radiate toward the people you care about the most. This is a day to take action on your feelings instead of swallow them without a word.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|3|4|You may find that others are hostile toward you today, Cancer. Try not to take it personally. Realize that there are other people and situations with which you can connect that will help bolster your ego instead of drag it down. Make deeper connections with your loved one tonight by indulging in some adventure fantasies. Shared experiences will be extremely rewarding at this time.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|3|5|Put your incredible sensitivity to work for you today in a way that inspires action, Leo. There's so much within you that needs expression at this time. Don't hold back any longer. When it comes to issues regarding love and romance, feel free to make a move. You may be attracted to those who tickle your brain cells. Philosophical discussions will be quite rewarding.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|3|6|Things should be going well for you today, so don't miss the opportunities that await you, Virgo. There's a sparkle in your eye that's unmistakable, and you will find that issues regarding love and romance are especially potent. Love is on your side. You should take this opportunity to delve deeply into a love affair. Take a trip with the people you enjoy most.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|3|7|Don't let other people's insensitive actions dictate your mood today, Libra. Your state of mind is your responsibility, and you should work to come to a point at which you have full control over what you feel at all times. If something isn't working out, let it go. This isn't a good time to try to stick a square peg in a round hole.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|3|8|You should find that you have an extra amount of creative energy now, Scorpio, and you should do what you can to make this force work for you. There's a time and place for everything, and now is the time to work together with your higher self to channel some of the artist within. Don't let your self-doubt keep you from using the creative force that's brewing inside you.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|3|9|You may have been a bit indecisive lately when it comes to love and romance, Sagittarius. Perhaps your mind is drawn to one person while your heart is drawn to another. Perhaps you're trying to trick your mind into seeing a certain quality in someone while you ignore parts that you don't really like. Make sure you accept people for all of who they are and not just the individual parts.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|3|10|You're apt to be in a romantic mood today, Capricorn. Your whole being may revolve around love and romance. You will find that your romanticism is heightened. This is a terrific day to snuggle up to a loved one and share intimate moments and passionate kisses. Pamper yourself with a hot bath and feel free to go out on the town.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|3|11|Feel free to strike out for new territory today, Aquarius, especially when it comes to love and romance. It could be that you're so scared of losing what you have that you refuse to take risks to obtain something better that you want. Realize that you will never get any further than the rut you're in until you take a deep breath, aim high, and shoot for your dreams.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|3|12|Things regarding love and romance may be climactic for you now, Pisces, and you may bump heads with someone in a way that makes it difficult for either one of you to be content. More than likely there's an issue of freedom versus control that's making it difficult to find a resolution. Perhaps you need to give a certain issue a break and come back to it later.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|1|Walk to the beat of your own drum, Aries. If you try to latch on to the glib, fast-paced information of the day, you might lose your voice in the crowd. On the other hand, if you plant your feet firmly and try to plan in too much detail, you might deprive yourself of spontaneous events that prove fulfilling. Chart your own course, and don't be afraid if no one else comes along.|Capricorn|Leo|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|2|Connect with the person sitting next to you on the bus, Taurus, or the one behind you in line at the store. He or she may have a piece of wisdom to share that will change your life forever. Know that you, too, could be that person who changes someone else's life with a single thought or piece of wisdom. Communication is the key to expanding your world in many ways.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|4|3|Your self-esteem may be challenged by a fast-paced talker or unpleasant situation, Gemini. Don't accept things as they appear at first glance. There's a much deeper meaning brewing below the surface, and you'd be foolish not to recognize this when it comes around. Stick to your guns and stay grounded. Newfangled devices and big promises may not be all they're advertised to be.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|4|4|Jump on board the fast train and see how far it takes you, Cancer. You will be surprised how far you can go with minimal effort. Your grace and polite manners will help you navigate to where you need to be. You're your own ship and there is a large gust of wind filling your sails. Make the most of this energy by shooting for the top and not resting until you get there.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|4|5|Flexibility is important today, Leo. Take the relaxed, laid-back approach. Trying to ram your ideas through isn't the best tactic. Having tunnel vision will restrict you in many ways. Keep an open mind and be receptive to other people's ideas and opinions. You have a great deal of power at your fingertips. It would be a shame to waste it by not having the breadth of vision to see all your options.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|6|Things coming at you from all sides are forcing you to make a move, Virgo. Try not to feel pressured into something you don't want to do. A nervous restlessness is apt to take over your being and urge you to act. Don't let other people's energies dictate your actions. Secure your position and be strong. Don't be lured into situations you know are bad for you.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|7|Lock into the practical, grounding force that is not only realistic but also flexible. Attend to details and organize yourself, Libra. Be aware that you may need to alter your course in order to fit with the group energy. Try to work together with those around you to achieve a common goal. Initiating the help of others is easier than you think as long as you stay focused and motivated.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|8|Today is one of those days in which prosperity is much closer than you think, Scorpio. You will find what you seek, but it's up to you to take the first step to going after it. More than likely, you're looking for solid answers to your deep and probing questions. Don't let your inquisitive mind rest until you find the answers that ring true for you.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|4|9|Indecision may leave you helpless at a crossroads today, Sagittarius. Others around you could be just as undecided regarding their direction. At the same time, you may feel pressured to take immediate action and you're tired of waiting for others to make the first move. Find answers in simple solutions. There's more than one correct way to go. Your choice is the right one if you believe it.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|4|10|Latch on to the expansiveness that comes when you connect with others in the social arena, Capricorn. Communication is a key part of the day. You will find that if you go with the flow, you will land exactly where you need to be. Take the adventurous route and feel free to skip around from one thing to another. There's no need to pin yourself down to only one way of doing something.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|4|11|Connect with the stable, grounding energy of the day, Aquarius, but beware that tension may come in the form of fast talk and misguided information. People might be fickle and frantic. Wait for the dust to settle before you pick which road to take. Impulsive decisions are apt to lead you down paths that might not be the best choice for you now. Try not to think too much!|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|4|12|The expansive feeling you might be experiencing is apt to be squelched today as you get the feeling that you've lost touch with reality. Make sure you connect with real life, Pisces, and do a bit of planning to balance your whimsical nature. Things that you haven't accounted for might crop up and hit you, serving as a reminder that you need to deal with the here and now.|Capricorn|Cancer|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|1|Make sure you get your daily dose of laughter and try to come out of your shell a bit more, Aries. This is an important time for you to let go of your inhibitions and open up to the world. You may find that there's a sober tone to your emotions, but you can overcome this easily as long as you keep your chin up. There's no reason for you to be gloomy.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|5|2|This is an important day for you to give thanks for all that you have, Taurus. Give your loved ones extra hugs and let them know how much they mean to you. If things start to get a bit too serious and somber, you're the one who can pull others out of the rut. There is no need to be sad when you have so much to be happy about.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|5|3|Maintain a positive attitude, Gemini, and things will naturally flow your way. Tell a few jokes and keep things light and energetic. You will find that you can multitask very well and you have the ability to make everyone smile. Don't shy away from things - move toward them. Put away your self-doubt and be more proactive in your approach to everything you encounter.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|5|4|You may be reluctant to commit to anything major today, Cancer. Your natural tendency is to look askance at those who promise grand and wonderful things. You're smart to question such talk. Don't be surprised if someone's new idea garners all the acclaim. Don't buy into it without first hearing the facts. It isn't a good day for you to gamble, either.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|5|This may be one of those days when you feel completely alone even if there are hundreds of people around, Leo. No one seems to understand your perspective. Your incredible sensitivity and emotionalism is putting you in a category all your own. Try not to ostracize yourself from the group. Reach out instead of pull away. You have more in common with other people than you think.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|6|Balance your boisterous, adventurous nature with a bit of discipline today, Virgo. It's important to laugh, but it's also important to stay on task with your duties. The good news is that both of these things can work in tandem. They aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, one will help you achieve the other. Be serious, but have a good time and keep things in perspective.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|7|There may be a thousand things for you to do today, Libra, but you can only get them done if you concentrate on one at a time. Take a lighthearted approach. You will never finish by focusing on the sheer amount of work you have to do. Break it up into smaller pieces and delegate tasks if you can. Try to see the fun side of things. Schedule in breaks and snacks.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|5|8|No matter what you're doing today, have fun, Scorpio. Whistle a tune. Turn the stereo up to full volume and dance around the kitchen as you make dinner. You can find amusement in just about anything, so keep this in mind as you tackle even the menial tasks. You're responsible for your own attitude, so don't blame anyone else for a sour mood. Turn yourself around and have fun.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|5|9|You might need to spend time alone in order to reset your programming, Sagittarius. Other people's influence may be seeping into your psyche. There's no reason to always do or say what other people dictate. Your sensitivity helps you understand things about others, but it can also bring you down if you start to take on their burdens. Try to counterbalance this tendency with more of your own energy.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|5|10|You will find that discipline, organization, and a bit of a dramatic flair are exactly the things needed to be successful today, Capricorn. Just because you have to be practical doesn't mean that you have to be stern and grumpy. Remember that taking care of serious matters can actually be fun as long as you maintain a positive attitude about the situation. A smile goes a long way.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|11|You might find it difficult to deal with people on an emotional level today, Aquarius. Others could seem too demanding of your attention, and want to keep the focus on themselves. At the same time, you will probably need a bit more attention than usual. Try not to be so stubborn! Give people the love they need and you will find that the love you require will come to you as well.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|5|12|You might find your emotions a bit dampened today, Pisces, but this may not be a bad thing. Try not to blow things out of proportion so much. Don't feel that you need to turn every small story into a major headline. There's no need to exaggerate the truth just to get more attention. Take a more reserved approach to your actions and reactions to all situations.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|6|1|Communication is a key part of the day, Aries. You will find that a great deal of information is available to you when you ask for it. You can pull from many different resources, so don't be afraid to tap the different wells available to you. Emotionally, this may not be the best day for you, but you can overcome this as long as you keep a lighthearted, optimistic approach.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|6|2|Bring things back into balance, Taurus. You've probably been so focused on yourself that you've completely forgotten about others. It's time to fill in the rest of the equation and take into account what other people feel. Balance is crucial in every part of your life so that you maintain a healthy viewpoint. A clear mind allows you to see the truth of what's really going on.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|6|3|This is a good day to look at the big picture and discuss your ideas with others, Gemini. As you walk down the street, make sure you pay attention to what's going on around you. If you continue to be preoccupied by one issue, you may never see some of the other important pieces of the greater whole even though they're obvious to everyone else.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|6|4|You will be in an excellent mood, Cancer, and find your positive attitude amplified as you come into contact with more and more people. The one thing to watch out for today is laziness. There may be a great deal of it going around, especially in your camp. Don't waste the good energy of the day sitting around and doing nothing - even though it's quite tempting.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|6|5|Speak your mind clearly, Leo. Other people aren't mind readers like you are. If you keep waiting for someone to figure out what you're thinking, it will be a long time before the truth comes out. Give people a break and let them know what's going on inside your head. Communication is important, and today it begins with you. Feel free to take the first step toward opening the door.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|6|6|You can soar to great heights on a moment's notice today, Virgo. There's a fast-paced, socially minded quality to the day that will encourage people to share more of themselves with others. You will find a great deal of support from many different people now. Welcome this help with open arms. Don't try to do things by yourself when you're surrounded by such a strong team spirit.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|6|7|Try to see the positive in people, Libra. Relax and don't get so worked up over your internal drama. You're the one responsible for creating this turmoil. Find comfort in a creative project. Do something that you love to do that makes you truly happy. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's likely to amplify whatever mood you project.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|6|8|You should find that the adventurous side of you has the support of your emotions, Scorpio. These two parts of your spirit are working in harmony to help you stretch beyond your limits. Push into new realms and ask questions when you don't understand something. This is the only way you will learn, develop, and grow mentally and emotionally. Don't assume learning stops when you leave school.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|6|9|Dress in your very best today, Sagittarius. Feel free to kick up your heels and take on the town. This is a great time to go out with friends, socialize, and have a fabulous time. Put your worries aside and join a group for some lighthearted fun and merriment. Keep a smile on your face and you will find that you can walk through any door you choose.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|6|10|You will find that the more peaceful and understanding you are today, Capricorn, the better off you will be in general. Doors will open and people will welcome you with great fanfare. Be the diplomat instead of the warrior. Focus on the positive aspects of the equation instead of the negative. Luck and prosperity will come your way when you have this attitude wherever you go.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|6|11|Make sure you leave things in better condition than you found them, Aquarius. This is a good time to tidy your personal space and the environment. This is also a great time to do some shopping for yourself. Just be careful that you don't spend too much money. When beautiful things catch your eye, it might be hard for you to resist them, regardless of how much they cost.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|6|12|This is one of those days in which it's easier to be yourself, Pisces. Don't feel like you need to change your personality to fit a situation. You naturally add an important dynamic to the group. Your detached, unbiased, and knowledgeable view of the situation will be an important asset to today's events. People would do well to listen to you, so be bold when expressing yourself.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|1|You're going to think this is a strange period. It isn't, Aries. It's just that today won't be like others. Look around and you will see that people are either depressed or trying to keep up a good faade. It's as if lots people - you in particular - are being confronted by their dreams without being able to act on them. This isn't an easy situation to be in.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|7|2|Today, Taurus, you might get the chance to take a trip around the world to visit fabulous palaces and experience a timeless love, and all - get this - totally free! This could be called a sensitivity test to the universe of Walt Disney. Goodness knows that you aren't a total stranger to it! By now, you've learned from hard experience that fantasyland is for Mickey Mouse.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|3|You will float today, Gemini. You won't talk, you will be sleepy, and your mood won't be the best. OK, perfect! Get back into your novel, take several siestas, and do as little as possible, because that's what you want to do. Don't worry, busy beaver, this period will pass. And you know what? You aren't alone here. It happens to everyone from time to time. Flow with it.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|4|You're certainly in a strange mood today, Cancer. True, things have been going smoothly for the past few days, but be careful not to be fooled. Pride goes before a fall, as they say. Today you should be wary of your behavior toward your lover. Your partner's attitude may dismay you, but you're the one who has strayed from reality. Stay away from any trigger points that could explode into an argument.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|5|It will be as though you're in a new and hopeful world today, Leo. The people you meet will be cordial and caring, and the future will seem like a bright, attractive place to live. In other words, it's like a fabulous dream, and the alarm clock is bound to wake you up soon. True, the glorious feeling won't last long, so take advantage of the day. Reality is sweet at times.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|7|6|Because you have a tendency to brood over everything right now, Virgo, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find satisfaction within the realm of the known world lately, but today offers you a journey into another perception, one that's intangible and unreal. You may find it gratifying, especially if you try some artistic, esoteric, or religious activity.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|7|7|There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for your happiness. But if you count the number of times when you do things against your will, it becomes obvious that logic and reason don't always apply to this world. Don't even try to understand. Just enjoy!|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|7|8|The day ahead should be excellent, Scorpio. For the past several days you've been searching for meaning in life. There have been changes in your chief occupation, new relationships, bursting ambitions. Today you can let all of that soul searching go. You're likely to whip up a huge mixture of the whole experience and be grateful for the thrilling life you lead right now!|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|9|You will probably be perfectly in tune with the day ahead, Sagittarius. Of course, it's tempting to run away from the reality and hardships of the moment. But at other times, when you're so compassionate and find it easy to listen, like today, life is really rewarding. People find your company soothing and pleasant, and they're likely to thank you for it. Aren't days like this great?|Libra|Aries|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|10|Don't try to control what happens today, Capricorn, because you won't be able to fathom what's going on. How could it be otherwise when collective currents are interfering with your life? You may do some soul-searching because you may feel that you're only a grain of sand in a vast universe. Don't spend too much time staring at your belly button. Look around you for some of the answers.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|7|11|This kind of strange day doesn't come around often, Aquarius. It will seem as though you no longer know what you want. Do you have a yen to take off for the other side of the globe? People won't understand you, and you will think that explaining yourself is pointless. The best thing to do may be to unplug from your usual activities and go for a walk. You have nothing to lose.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|7|12|Do other countries represent real openings for you? This is a question that you will soon have to answer. This may be true, but it may also be an illusion that gives you a simplistic explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel now in your professional life. Think about it, because some important decisions you're about to make depend on it. You aren't the only one to consider, either.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|8|1|If you're involved in an occupation similar to that of your mother or father, Aries, today you may question if the choice was yours or preordained. Did you take this career path of your own volition? If not, what is it that you should really be doing with your professional life? You feel rebellious and yearn for more independence. You might want to find more freedom within the confines of your existing career.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|2|Most people form their opinions on the basis of what they're told by a few people who supposedly know what they're talking about. Certain ideas become fashionable. Today, Taurus, you have no patience for these tendencies. In fact, you're tempted to use vulgar language just to shock the pseudo-intellectuals out of their complacency. Alas, you can't do it. They will simply raise an eyebrow and turn away.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|3|If you're involved with theater, dance, or painting, the day ahead will be a bright one for you, Gemini. You feel a strong desire to bring people together in pursuit of some artistic endeavor. Listen to your longings. You're likely to be a sharp talent scout, or at the very least, a person who is able to enhance other people's talents.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|4|Today you can expect to have some disagreements with your partner or friend, Cancer. You may overreact. If you do, it's only because the climate of the last few days has made you feel more vulnerable than usual. It's your tendency when faced with tension to be the first to back down. Try not to do it this time. Sometimes self-sacrifice comes at too high a cost.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|8|5|Today you will be confrontational, Leo. This comes after several weeks of holding yourself back from openly criticizing other people. You have especially strong feelings concerning anything that touches activities outside of the family. An explosion is imminent and likely unavoidable. Go ahead and express yourself. You will all be best friends again tomorrow!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|8|6|You must be wondering what in the world is going on? On the one hand, you have humanistic and harmonious thoughts about your family and work environment. On the other hand, you also have a deep desire to destroy everything in order to start fresh! You will have to choose. In any case, given the current climate and the fire inside you, any sort of compromise will prove difficult. Don't go overboard!|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|8|7|You may be planning for the future, Libra, yet find yourself needing to make choices that will resonate far beyond the next few months. It's possible that you will have to consider sending your children to a new school, for example, or decide to move across the country. These are big decisions, to be sure, but trust that you won't be making them alone. Your loved ones have a say in these matters!|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|8|You can expect to be volatile today, Scorpio! No one will dare contradict you or insinuate that you've taken your ideas from others. You have the potential to get really angry. Rather than say things you might later regret, write down your thoughts. And if you do feel the need to make a speech, do it in public.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|9|Don't hesitate to speak up for what is right, Sagittarius, even if it means confronting someone with power. So be it. The slightest injustice can't be tolerated. When you voice your opinion, as you feel compelled to do, it makes others respect you. This has been a long time coming, and it does you a tremendous amount of good!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|8|10|Capricorn, no one has ever accused you of being overly diplomatic. In fact, since you have no compunction about saying what you think, your mouth regularly gets you into trouble. It's true that your verbal outbursts often relieve tension in tight situations, but there are times when kind words are a more effective way to get a point across. Why not try it?|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|8|11|There's some likelihood you'll become irritated with someone close to you today, Aquarius. Just who do they think they are, anyway? How insulting to put on such an act, especially considering how long you've known each other. Whatever you fight about, at the heart of it is your frustration and concern that your friendship may end. Try not to overreact. Express yourself mildly.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|8|12|Something's gotten into you today, Pisces. An iconoclastic imp inside you is determined to tear down every convention, especially in the art world. Why are you so furious with orthodoxy? Did you dream that an imitator stole one of your ideas and made a fortune with it? If you were an art critic, we would expect you to sing the praises of the vanguard.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|1|Money matters look uncertain and a bit deceptive, Aries. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of investment program, negotiate salaries or commissions, or change banks. Your dreams may be a bit disturbing, but this likely reflects fears from the past rather than dangers in the future. Write them down, however. You may learn a lot about yourself by studying the symbols.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|2|New people may come into your life today. If you get bad vibes from one of them, trust your instincts! Signs are that you will meet at least one new acquaintance who isn't trustworthy. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of partnership, nor is it a good day to get married or even propose marriage. Put all plans for cementing partnerships on hold for a few days!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|3|You might wake up feeling a little under the weather, perhaps too tired to go anywhere, and you'll want to stay in. Perhaps this is the best course of action for today. You may be tired and a bit stressed out, Gemini, and more vulnerable than usual to any bugs may be going around at this time. Drink lots of juices and get some rest. Tomorrow you will probably feel much better.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|9|4|Today you might get the feeling that someone in your family is hiding something. The atmosphere might be strained and somewhat tense. Your natural inclination is to try to spread oil on troubled waters to return the situation to normal, Cancer, but this isn't likely to be the right course of action here. Let things ride. Whoever is hiding something isn't likely to reveal it.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|9|5|Gossip you hear today might make you angry. You're likely to sense it isn't true. Take nothing at face value today. Check the facts before making any judgments. Discontent is in the air, Leo, and when people are disgruntled, they tend to say things they don't mean. Avoid the temptation to be confrontational. It will only make things worse. Try to spend some time alone if you can.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|9|6|There is more than meets the eye to a money situation today, Virgo. There could be errors in your financial records, or someone may not be telling the truth about an important item. You're a caring, trusting person, but this isn't the day to blindly accept anyone's statements. Check the facts and see for yourself, then act accordingly in order to see to your own best interests.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|7|Today, Libra, you probably aren't going to feel very friendly. You're most likely to want to sequester yourself at home and not see or speak to anyone. If your need for solitude is that strong, indulge it. You won't do yourself any good by forcing contact with others. You might feel a little out of sorts physically, so it's especially important to eat right and get lots of vitamin C.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|8|Self-control is the word for today, Scorpio. Others' unethical behavior could trigger some long-buried anger that might make you want to lash out at those responsible. This won't solve anything. The best way to handle these rather explosive emotions is honest communication, but today it could deteriorate into arguments. Try counting to ten before confronting anyone. It works!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|9|9|Anger and resentment caused by past hurts could come up today, at times tempting you to burst into tears. Don't fight it. Just find someplace where you can be alone and let it out. This is only a symptom of personal and spiritual growth on your part. Releasing the past clears the way for breakthroughs in the future. You could wake up tomorrow morning feeling like a changed person!|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|10|Someone you think of as a friend may prove less than trustworthy today, Capricorn. There are indications of deception all around you. Perhaps someone is keeping something from you or telling outright lies. Don't be too suspicious of anyone, but check the facts of a situation before you take someone's word for anything. It's always best to do that anyway.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|9|11|"Something underhanded is going on, Aquarius. Unethical people could be trying to manipulate certain situations in order to turn them to their own benefit. Be careful! Steer clear of any ""political"" conversations, and refrain from commenting on any situation or listening to gossip. On the positive side, your intuition is sharp, so you should be able to sense the trustworthy."|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|9|12|If you've been thinking about executing legal papers of any kind, Pisces, this isn't the day to do it. Any contract entered into today is likely to have confusing clauses and obscure language that you may not understand and that potentially could be used against you. This also isn't the day to start or even plan a journey of any kind. However, it's a great day for reading or meditation.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|1|The desire to beautify your home could hit you full force today, Aries. Perhaps you're expecting visitors or house guests and want to make a good impression. You could prowl through antique stores looking for knickknacks. You might set your sights on doing something a bit more ambitious than you originally planned. Enjoy yourself, but be careful. You don't want to tire yourself out.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|2|A new neighbor could arrive who you feel especially drawn to, Taurus. You might have high hopes for a friendship with this person. He or she may seem especially congenial and share a lot of your interests, and this could seem almost too perfect. However, you're in just the mood to idealize new relationships, so don't get too excited until you get to know this person better.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|10|3|You could be feeling especially sociable today. Maybe there's a party of some kind in your neighborhood. You could hear some good news, and there is probably some truth to it, but take everything you hear through the grapevine with a grain of salt. Not everything you hear is based on fact. If you can, go to someone in a position to know and find out from him or her.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|10|4|You're feeling especially loving, attractive, and romantic, so romance is likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies could seem especially appealing. If you're currently involved, you will probably receive a lot of attention from your mate. If not, expect to receive admiring glances from those around you, including strangers! You could meet a potential date, but take care to get to know this person before getting too excited.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|10|5|An increased level of ESP and imagination could have you feeling more creative and artistic. You might want to channel this energy into writing, painting, or adding touches to your living room. You're likely to be especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, particularly family. You could grow closer, especially if you sense what they need even before they do.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|6|An attractive neighbor with whom you seem to share a bond could become a friend. A group you're affiliated with could be expressing highly idealized goals and purposes. These goals are likely to be admirable, Virgo, but they may not be all that realistic. Bear that in mind before committing to any course of action. You need more facts before you can proceed.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|7|Dreams of a new career could fill your mind today, perhaps because of too much stress in your current one. You might even think of becoming a movie star! Go for your dream if you feel it's what you want, Libra. Remember that any moneymaking enterprise, no matter how creative, is still a business. Make use of your natural business talent to find out what you need to know.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|10|8|Spiritual goals may be at the top of your priority list now, Scorpio. You may be looking for metaphysical seminars or meditation workshops, perhaps taking place in a distant state or foreign country. You're likely to find it difficult to make a decision about any options right now. Whatever you're considering, make sure you know all the facts before making a choice of any kind.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|9|Lovely dreams could spark your imagination and get your artistic abilities going. You could learn a lot about yourself and whatever has been limiting you. Write down whatever comes your way so you can work with it later, but don't try to make sense of it today. Wait a while and then consider everything in a more practical light. You may be surprised at the difference in you.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|10|10|A new friend could arrive today, Capricorn. You're probably going to like this person very much. He or she probably shares many of your interests. You could become close friends. The downside is that you aren't likely to see anyone as they really are, only an idealized picture. When you meet this person, make an effort to see the real person behind the mask and accept them as they are.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|11|"If you've been thinking about a job change or even a new career, a chance encounter could provide the opportunity. However, Aquarius, remember, ""If something seems too good to be true, it probably is."" Get the facts as clearly as you can. Consider all the ins and outs before committing yourself or getting too excited about it. If you still want to pursue the opportunity, go for it.
                
             "|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|10|12|A journey by air to a distant place might be on your mind, though you might not make it for a long time. Knowledge is important to you, and you can be insatiably curious. This is likely to be one of those days, Pisces. A friend or lover could bring some new information that sparks your curiosity, perhaps something related to astrology or the occult. You will want to pursue it.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|11|1|Arguments over money might come up, Aries. This might not involve your own funds but money belonging to a group with which you're involved. Try to be logical. This isn't a good day to set your sights on new goals or make definite plans. Wait a day or two. If you start today, your project could be fraught with delays, interruptions, or disagreements.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|11|2|A disagreement with a business or romantic partner could turn into an argument today. This won't do anything to increase the effectiveness of your relationship, Taurus. If the smallest hint of a difference of opinion comes up, try to settle it before it gets too heated. Try to be objective and see the other person's point of view. Don't let a minor dispute turn into a power struggle.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|11|3|Plans for a trip could go awry today because of circumstances beyond your control. A postponement might be necessary. This might prove very frustrating for you because you've been anxious to get going. Don't question the workings of the Universe, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Whatever setbacks you suffer today might in the long run prove to be blessings in disguise.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|11|4|An upsetting dream may disturb your sleep tonight, Cancer. Some disturbing information about finances could prove upsetting today. This might involve your personal funds, those of a friend, the funds of an organization you're involved with, or the world economy in general. Don't go crazy before you find out the true facts. The information is probably erroneous.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|2 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|11|5|It could be hard to complete tasks today. A disagreement with other household members might give you the idea that everyone is against you. This isn't so, Leo. Try to be objective and consider other points of view, and don't turn this into a power struggle. Stay calm, take a deep breath, and try to communicate with the others. The results could prove pleasantly surprising!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|11|6|Today you might need to run a lot of errands, Virgo. This could prove frustrating. Traffic could be bad, you might not find what you need, and it may be difficult to reach those you need to consult. These are all circumstances beyond your control, so it's best to find something else to do. This is a great day to stay in and research matters that you may want to put to use.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|11|7|Your practicality and good sense prove invaluable today, Libra. Those close to you might be restless and upset, and you might have to steer them in the right direction. A close friend or lover may experience a financial upset, and you could be asked to help out. This isn't a good day to make a loan, although it's favorable for helping others find their own solutions.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|11|8|A problem with your house - plumbing, electricity, phones - might necessitate calling in professionals, Scorpio. This might prove mildly irritating, as strangers could be going in and out all day, and you or other members of your household might be temporarily housebound when you have obligations elsewhere. Don't take your frustrations out on others. This will all pass by tomorrow!|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|11|9|An unexpected, upsetting letter or phone call might come today. This isn't major bad news, Sagittarius. It's more likely to be the irritating little setbacks that force you to go more out of your way than you'd expected. Problems might pop up with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology. Grit your teeth and do what it takes to move on. It won't help to get crazy.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|11|10|A sudden, irritating interruption in your routine could come your way today, Capricorn. A friend may need some advice, and you could feel obliged to give it, which would put your own projects on hold for a while. Don't be too irritated with this person, however. You might regret it later. You might also have some troubles with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars

2016|12|17|10|Give it a rest today, Capricorn. Recharge your batteries. Stick close to home and take a load off your feet. Convince someone to give you a massage, or better yet, go to a professional. You deserve a break. Once you're restored, consider all the ramifications of whatever actions you take before you start. Plan your moves carefully. Be strong and decisive not rash and frantic.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|17|11|Feel free to move forward with your plans, Aquarius. This is a great day to take action. You've done a great deal of data collecting and analyzing lately. Now is the time to put that information to good use. You're helped by an extra boost of inner confidence and emotional strength. Your grounded, conservative approach will be richly rewarded. You couldn't ask for a more productive day!|Sagittarius|Taurus|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|17|12|You may have a hard time getting started today, Pisces. This might be a better time to plan. Be realistic and thoughtful in your actions. Be conscious of the steps you need to take to reach a certain goal. When in doubt, take the more conservative route. You will find that there is a great deal of support for that path. Don't get distracted along the way. Stay on target.|Capricorn|Cancer|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|18|1|Be conscious of your own needs, Aries, and feel free to be a little selfish. Give yourself the credit you deserve, and don't let other people bully you into feeling like you aren't worthy of the attention you receive. You have a great number of gifts to offer the world, and you shouldn't be afraid to show them off. Lighten up and be proud. Other people are lucky to know you.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|18|2|Your energy and spunk should finally return after a couple days of feeling slightly down, Taurus. You should enjoy a good mood all day. Your powers of persuasion are strong. There's an extra boost of energy behind your emotions. You will find that this could lead to some sort of transformation deep within. Whatever you do, do it with passion. Let your courageous nature shine through.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|18|3|Get out of the mud, Gemini. Have fun and don't worry too much about the consequences. Put your to-do list aside for a while and focus on enjoying yourself. People are going to need some extra attention today, so be generous with your hugs and kisses. Your emotions are powerful and dynamic. The intensity behind your words reflects your passion.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|18|4|Your emotions may be volatile right now, Cancer. There's passion behind your words. You have the power to instigate major changes in your life. If you're wise, you will consider multiple ways to make them. Find the part of you that needs a boost, the area that lacks passion. Jump-start the battery that rules this aspect of your being, and make sure all your cylinders are firing.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|18|5|If you aren't careful about the energy you dish out today, Leo, you will find that it all comes back to smack you in the face. Other people are likely to be as stubborn as you, so proceed cautiously. The more you try to control and manipulate others, the more friction will build. Things are likely to explode. Adopt a friendly attitude and try not to take anything too seriously.|Aries|Libra|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|18|6|Today is a fantastic day for you, Virgo. You should enjoy a good mood and positive experiences with others. There's most likely a slow-moving, transforming energy in your life right now that's touching off your emotions. You will find that there is a great deal of fire and passion fueling your heart, so be generous with your kind spirit and follow through with your promises.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|18|7|Other people may be demanding of you, Libra, so do what you can to please the crowd. Don't go overboard in thinking you need to be someone you're not, and certainly don't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Be generous with your affection, but make sure you receive emotional support in return. There are likely to be some imbalances that need minor adjustments.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|18|8|People may be somewhat selfish and self-centered today, but this doesn't mean that you have to follow suit, Scorpio. Remind others of the importance of the collective. We all need to pitch in and do our part to be happy. You have the ability to offer balance to the situation, and you should definitely put this to the test. Do what you can to make the scales tip back to center.|Leo|Aquarius|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|18|9|It may not be the easiest day to relate to others, Sagittarius, but as usual, if you just go with the flow, you will find that you can have fun. Try not to get caught up in anyone else's drama. There are likely to be soap operas playing all around you, and you would do well to steer clear of them. Maintain a lighthearted attitude today and try not to read into anything too deeply.|Libra|Aries|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|18|10|Things should flow extremely well for you, Capricorn. Load your engine with extra fuel, because you will be burning red hot. Don't let anything stand in your way. By all means, fight for what you need. There's a great deal of power behind your emotions, and you will find that the intensity of your feelings is real and courageous whether you're laughing or crying.|Scorpio|Aries|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|18|11|You need bigger and longer hugs than usual today, Aquarius. A powerful force is moving through your life and trying to shake things up. Don't stoop to the level of petty argument and verbal sparring. The more you resist the opposition, the more stubborn and unwieldy the situation becomes. Make sure you have a good hold on your emotions before you leave the house.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|18|12|Act with courage today, Pisces. Dress as if you were going to meet an important statesman. See yourself in the mirror and be proud to say you look good. Take action with confidence and feel free to strut your stuff. Be up-front with your accomplishments, and let people know you're strong and trustworthy. Make sure you give many compliments, credit, and thanks to the people around you.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|19|1|One thing is for sure, Aries, you'd rather be in bed with a good book than out in the stressful world. But you may be feeling like you're missing out on some of the good things in life. How much time do you spend with other people? Why not try to find someone who shares your taste for good books and bed? Think about it!|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|19|2|Your greatest quality is generosity, Taurus. Your nature isn't to give to others in order to get something back but for the pleasure of giving. This is how you get power and light. Think of all the people in the world who give of themselves without expecting anything in return. You don't have to make much effort to be one of those people - just give it a try.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|19|3|It's important to take a hard look at yourself and know where you're going, Gemini. A little self-analysis never hurt anyone, especially when you feel like you aren't getting anywhere. But you have a tendency to go a little overboard with self-criticism. Take today to try and ignore that little voice in your head, or even prove it wrong!|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|19|4|Cancer, you have a tendency to run away from confrontation, but today you might not be able to avoid it. Your partner or a family member may be putting pressure on you. It's possible you've already worked out a solution to this problem. Tell your partner what he or she wants to hear so you can do what you want later.|Pisces|Virgo|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|19|5|You may feel a little weary today, Leo. It's a good time to take stock of your life. You may have gotten some news about someone that has caused you some pain. This is a good time to rely on the support of your relationship in order to reenergize yourself. Take the time to let others take care of you.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|19|6|You have the gift of being able to get your great ideas across to others. In your family, you may be the one who teaches your children about life and its responsibilities. Today someone might teach you something you didn't know. You should never forget that education means communication, and communication is the exchange of ideas.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|19|7|There may be tension in the air as you go about your day, Libra. The leftover fatigue from the past few days is starting to wear on you. You may have managed to get into an argument with someone close to you, but there might be a reason for this. Take advantage of the situation to clear the air with your friend.|Cancer|Capricorn|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|19|8|"You don't live your life by society's rules, Scorpio. Your freedom is what is most important to you. But despite your independence, there are days when you have the sudden, sinking feeling that you could wind up alone in this world. Today you should really begin to think about what the word ""commitment"" means to you. Is it really so scary?"|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|19|9|Sagittarius, life around you today almost seems like a (bad) dream. It's almost as if people are talking, but nothing intelligible is coming out of their mouths. Perhaps two people close to you are having problems getting along. You feel like stepping in and telling them to calm down and really listen to each other. Days like these are when people need you the most.|Libra|Pisces|Cancer|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|19|10|You can't spend all your time running from one activity to the next, Capricorn. You need to take a break from time to time. You have all the energy you need, but you should think about relaxing yourself as a whole. Your body may need its batteries recharged. Pretty soon you will be in the thick of the action and you will need all the energy you can get.|Scorpio|Taurus|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|19|11|Today's planetary configuration has you wondering about an aspect of your life that causes you a good deal of hardship, Aquarius. Maybe your partner is often away and this is particularly hard on you. You'd like your sweetie to be there through thick and thin. This may be causing some tension in your relationship. Have you talked to your partner about your feelings? If not, you really should.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|19|12|Pisces, you may have been a little difficult to be around lately. You like to treat yourself to a little moodiness from time to time, but the people around you might appreciate a little cooperation. There are days when you don't want to grow up, when it's time to play. Do you get enough time to play? Think about it.|Sagittarius|Taurus|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|20|1|You may be inclined to stay in bed today with the latest best seller, Aries. Who wouldn't want to spend the day this way? Alas, that isn't going to happen. The planets are practically pulling the covers off you and pushing you out of bed. There's work to be done! And more importantly, there are people you need to see right now. Put a bookmark in the book. It can wait.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|20|2|You have a lot to offer, Taurus. Everyone appreciates what you have to contribute. Yet you've been unable to give yourself credit for all that you've accomplished. It would be worthwhile to take some time to contemplate why this is so. You have a strong need to be loved, but you must first love yourself. Your family and friends will support you, but first you must support yourself.|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|20|3|Whether you acknowledge it or not, there's a child inside you who needs tending, Gemini. You're proud of the person you've become - and well you should be. But you're the product of who you once were. Today's planetary positions suggest you acknowledge all parts of your past - the good and the bad. Only after you've integrated all the elements can you be the person you're meant to be.|Aquarius|Leo|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|20|4|Think of today as a well-earned rest day, Cancer. You're usually the one people turn to when they need consolation. Today, in spite of the tension in the air, your words seem to have no effect. Let other people take care of themselves for a change. You can spend your time quietly reading a good book. It's much more relaxing to get involved in drama that's fictional rather than real.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|20|5|Today take stock of all that's occurring on the home front, Leo. Think back over the last few months and you will see how much of your attention has been on work rather than loved ones. There's probably some fallout as a result. Fortunately, a few days in close contact with family will put everything right. You can't blame them for wanting to be with you. Try to indulge them.|Aries|Scorpio|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|20|6|Think long and hard before making commitments, Virgo. Much is at stake, especially where your love life is concerned. It's likely that a proposal is coming your way. Do you know how you will answer? Events may have you feeling like you're at a crossroads when actually you're more on track than ever. The key lies in trusting your instincts and remaining true to your ideals.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|20|7|You will be busy today, Libra. Nevertheless, you still may end the day with your desk piled high with projects - not because you're unproductive, but rather because you're popular and your work is valued. You may be wishing you weren't quite so valuable! Don't get stressed about all you have to do. No one expects you to get it all done immediately. Get some rest. Tomorrow is another day.|Leo|Aquarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|20|8|You've been working exceptionally hard, Scorpio. Today is a good day to recharge your batteries. It seems everyone wants a piece of you. You may have reached the point where you have nothing left to give. It's OK to say so. If possible, take the phone off the hook and reserve the day for yourself. Sleep in, meditate, go for a walk - you get the idea!|Virgo|Aquarius|Gemini|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|20|9|Today could be a turning point for you, Sagittarius. Is it possible that you've finally learned how to say no? You're the one everyone asks for help. You spend so much time on other people's problems that you have little energy left for you. This situation ultimately helps no one. Put yourself first and there will be plenty of you left for others. If you're depleted, everyone loses.|Libra|Aries|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|20|10|Today's planetary positions urge you to assert yourself, Capricorn, but take care not to take this encouragement too far. You have a tendency to go a bit overboard when making a point. There are times (and this is one) when subtlety is more powerful. Try being low key and open rather than uptight and defensive. You have a warm personality, so why not let others experience it?|Libra|Aries|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|20|11|You have a strong creative component to your personality. You should use it more. Today's planetary positions will influence both your creativity and productivity. You will likely find yourself working as never before, and with better results. Take advantage of this phase while it lasts! This is your moment to prove to others just what you're capable of.|Scorpio|Aries|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|20|12|You're highly sensitive and highly intellectual, Pisces. This is a wonderful combination and part of what makes you a superstar. Today's planetary positions challenge you to think how you can best combine these two key components of your personality. Have you considered writing? It might provide the sort of balance you seek. Start writing and see if it suits you.|Scorpio|Taurus|Libra|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|21|1|You may feel a bit tied down today. It won't necessarily be a bad day, but you may wonder about certain aspects of your family life. Don't try and kid yourself. You should think hard about what you want for your family for the next few years and how you intend to go about getting it.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars
2016|12|21|2|There are days when you should take everything with a grain of salt. Today you may realize how important it is to gain the appreciation and respect of a certain person. It isn't worth getting worked up about. You will only make things worse. You may just need to do something that puts the fire back into your emotions.|Capricorn|Cancer|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|21|3|Gemini, you shouldn't even try to find a reasonable explanation for what goes on around you today. There isn't one. Be carried by the tides of emotions from the past that run through your body and soul. There's no use trying to control them - they need to come out. Instead, take the time to revitalize yourself in the intimacy of your home or at a friend's.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|21|4|Today you may ask yourself if you're satisfied. How is your personal life? Do people live up to your standards or are you always left feeling dissatisfied? It may be time to make some important decisions in your life. What do you really want out of life? You might find some of the answers today.|Pisces|Libra|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|21|5|Nothing is simple where your family is concerned. If you've forgotten that, don't worry. Today will remind you. You may have to deal with some of your lingering problems with certain family members. You will find you have all the energy you need in order to find the solutions to the conflicts that have been eating at you for a while.|Taurus|Scorpio|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|21|6|You like to give people advice and help them find direction in their lives - sometimes when they haven't even asked. But now it's your turn to feel a little lost. You may need to get away from it all to get some perspective on your life. What about taking a trip to some faraway land? Today is a good day to make your vacation plans.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|21|7|Libra, you may put your integrity under the microscope today. We all have deep convictions that we would never let go of. But society pressures us, and it isn't always easy to live in perfect harmony with our ideals. The question to ask yourself today is just how willing are you to change your most heartfelt beliefs in order to live in society? Do you have the courage of your convictions?|Leo|Capricorn|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|21|8|Your freedom is more important to you than anything else in your life. It's often very difficult for you to get involved, whether personally or professionally. Nevertheless, today you may have to think about it. Could it be that your thirst for freedom is just an escape? You may need to ponder this question. Who knows? You could decide to take the leap!|Virgo|Pisces|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|21|9|Certain very narrow-minded people may get on your nerves. You're lucky enough to be an open, tolerant person, Sagittarius. You take people and situations just as they come. Today you may find yourself in the middle of negotiations between two people with opposite views. Help them open their eyes to each other's point of view.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|21|10|"Today you will be able to explore the power of your emotions. Don't try and fight what you call your ""oversensitivity."" A force from childhood will permeate you and help you to find out what your real needs are. Shouldn't you think about staying away from people who influence you a little too much? Think about it and go with your emotions.
                
             "|Libra|Pisces|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|21|11|Aquarius, you feel secure in the warmth and depth of your emotions. Today you will have the opportunity to reenergize and regenerate yourself from the inside out. Take advantage of the energies at play to deepen your relationships with the people you love. Get to know them even better. Your powers of seduction will mesmerize them.|Libra|Aries|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|21|12|The atmosphere may seem a bit oppressive today, Pisces. You like to be free to do what you want to do, and it may bother you that the people around you don't make themselves available to you. They seem preoccupied by their own business. This could bring out some old wounds that haven't completely healed.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|22|1|Today is excellent for you, Aries. You will find that things flow naturally in the very way you've visualized. You might even find that things actually go much better than you had envisioned! Go about your endeavors confidently. The whole world isn't out to get you. In fact, people are probably too concerned with themselves to even bother with what you're doing.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|22|2|Be careful about the way your words come across to others, Taurus. You might not realize how much other people's feelings are affected until it's too late. Consider backing off for a while and taking a break from your normal performance. Practice your lines at home. You may be in a bit of a funk, but the good news is that you will snap out of it very soon.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|22|3|Today could be the day you've been waiting for, Gemini. Realize that you have the gentle, sincere nature necessary to sweet-talk your way through any situation. Indeed, if there is something that needs resolution, now would be a good time to smooth things over. People will be more receptive to your good nature and nurturing qualities.|Aquarius|Virgo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|22|4|Something is urging you to take action, Cancer. You may feel a restlessness in the air that makes you want to get up and go. The problem is the place you need to go may not be obvious at first. Tender emotions may get in the way of decisive action. Realize that your destination is inside your heart. We all go through moody periods. This could be one for you.|Aries|Libra|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|22|5|You will find that your emotions are much more under control today, Leo. You're able to strike a happy balance and avoid extraordinary extremes that scare others away. In fact, quite the opposite is true. People will be attracted to you as you provide a life raft on turbulent waters. Your sensitivity is strong and you're able to immediately fix on the status of any situation.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|22|6|Things may seem a little cloudy today, Virgo, but this is no reason to be blue. It could be that you need to make adjustments before you can smoothly relate to others. Take this opportunity to attend to things that you normally wouldn't think of. See things from the perspective of someone in another walk of life. Realize the fun of just staying home and falling asleep on the couch.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Aries|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|22|7|Try not to see the negative in everything today, Libra. Concentrate on the positive. You will pick up subtle signals from others that can be very helpful as you gather data throughout the day. As you proceed through it, keep in mind that everything need not be a race to the finish line. Enjoy where you are now. There's no reason to rush to the next activity if you're having fun.|Leo|Aquarius|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|22|8|Try to curb your tongue today, Scorpio. There's no reason to lash out. You will find that the more sensitive your approach, the farther you will get in your pursuit of your goals. Today might find you feeling moody, and your emotions could be running away with you. Get in touch with your feelings rather than push them away. They're probably trying to tell you something important.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|22|9|Your thinking is clear today, Sagittarius, and you will find that generally things are running smoothly. Your perspective on everything is very much in line with where you need to be at this time. In other words, you're doing everything exactly right. Be yourself and let other people adapt to your way of thinking. There's no need to keep hiding the truth of who you really are.|Virgo|Aquarius|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|22|10|Listen to what other people say to you today, Capricorn. There are valuable experiences waiting around the corner. The important thing to do now is recognize opportunities when they arise. The road to success isn't always well marked. Take a chance on the road with no signs at all. You have the courage and pioneering spirit to pursue the adventurous route, so go for it.|Virgo|Pisces|Leo|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|22|11|Your emotions may be more in tune with the world around you today, Aquarius. You could even feel a bit psychic. Go with your hunches. You will find that rational thinking may not be the best way to handle situations right now. Be the sensitive one who feels things before taking action. Discuss the issues with others and combine your resources for a more powerful alliance.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|22|12|You might second-guess yourself today, Pisces. Voices in your head are louder than usual, and you could be the one putting the brakes on your own train. Your intuition is trying to break through. See what you can do to slow down the chatter that continues to dictate the narrative throughout the day. Do more feeling instead of thinking. Give your mind a rest.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|23|1|Today is an excellent day for you, Aries. You will be a welcome addition to any crowd. Your delightful nature is at its most active. You have the unique capability to be aggressive about getting what you want without disturbing the flow of the energy around you. People respect and honor your sensitive, nurturing qualities. This will win the game for you.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars
2016|12|23|2|The world probably isn't going to revolve around you today, Taurus, so get used to it. Even though this may not be the news you want to hear, it's probably the news you most need to hear. Use your incredible passion to nurture others. Think less about yourself and more about the people around you, especially your family. Stick close to home and take care of chores.|Capricorn|Leo|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|23|3|Initiate a deep, meaningful conversation with someone you've lost touch with, Gemini. It could be that a long and ugly point of contention is on the brink of resolution. All you need to do is make the first move. There's a great deal of heartfelt, loving energy in the air that will help you foster a sensitive, tender approach. Find a connection with someone that you didn't know was there.|Pisces|Virgo|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|23|4|Your transmission may be stuck in reverse today, Cancer. This doesn't mean you can't be productive. You may need to change your approach. Carefully assess a situation before you proceed. Someone may be trying to cross you. Be smart about your rebuttal. Head-on combat isn't the best approach. Try reasoning. You may discover that there are pieces of the puzzle you didn't know about.|Taurus|Scorpio|Sagittarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|23|5|Things should go well for you today, Leo. There's an added serenity in the air that will help calm your nerves. There's no need to make things more complicated than necessary. The answers to things are actually quite simple. Everything you want is probably right at your fingertips. You don't need to go far to find what you seek.|Gemini|Scorpio|Pisces|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|23|6|It might seem like someone has dumped a bucket of water on your head today, Virgo. It seems like your fire is out. Keep in mind that this is only temporary and that your internal flame will be rekindled soon. For now, you may want to take this time to slow down and relax. Use this as an opportunity to reflect and tune in to your sensitive, caring nature. Let someone else take the reins.|Cancer|Capricorn|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|23|7|Tension may run high today as things come to a great emotional climax. It might seem as if everyone is out to get you, Libra, but more than likely this paranoia is a figment of your imagination. Don't get carried away with crazy scenarios that have no basis in reality. People may be acting irrationally, so don't be surprised if reason and logic are nowhere to be found.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|23|8|More than likely you will be caught up in a wildly intense emotional drama if you aren't careful, Scorpio. Try to stay calm and collected. Find a quiet, solitary place where you can relax. Your energy is there, but it may be more reserved and subtle on a day like this. Be the stable oasis in the raging turmoil. Make peace with the people around you.|Leo|Capricorn|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|23|9|You will find strength in your inner reserves today, Sagittarius. Don't hesitate to let your deepest thoughts shine through. Keep your antenna up. You will find that there's an electricity in the air that keeps people's emotions at peak level. Follow your instincts and keep in mind that this is probably your best defense against the challenges of the day. Rational thinking is overrated.|Leo|Aquarius|Cancer|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|23|10|You may feel a bit sluggish today, Capricorn. Your warrior spirit would rather stay home on the couch than get up and fight. This is fine. You may simply need a break from your quest for world domination. Remember that a good leader also takes the time to sit back and reflect on recent events in order to make better plans for the future.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|23|11|Your sensitivity is strong today, Aquarius. You will find that your perception of situations is right on target with the truth of the matter. Keep in mind that in order to be successful, you won't need to strong-arm anyone into doing what you want. More than likely you will be able to accomplish more just by tuning in to your receptive, gentle nature.|Scorpio|Gemini|Leo|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|23|12|You may feel a bit confused today. It might seem as if the wind has suddenly been taken out of your sails. Don't get discouraged by the slow weightiness of the day. Take the opportunity to relax and recharge your batteries. Do a bit of inward reflection as opposed to outer-directed movement. The most valuable lesson to learn is patience. Remind yourself of this throughout the day.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|24|1|This dreamy day is tailor made to your sensibilities. You may find it hard to focus on the daily issues when you're caught up in your fantasies. Go ahead and give in to the day's dreamlike state. Write in your journal or spend some time rummaging around in the attic. You'll be amazed at what you find. Expect to spend hours looking through scrapbooks and reliving your childhood.|Sagittarius|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|24|2|Your artistic side likes to mingle with people who are a shade off normal. You call them eccentric - other people call them crazy! From your viewpoint, the crazier the better! You feel such people add interest to the lives of anyone they come in contact with. Take a look in the mirror. You may see that you're such a person. Your energy and creativity add sparkle to others' lives.|Aquarius|Leo|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|24|3|You're conscientious where your health is concerned. You're one of the rare few who exercise and eat nutritious meals. Today you might want to expand your repertoire of medical remedies. If you've been struggling to shake a cold or allergy, consider some alternative medicines. They're moving more into the mainstream. Chinese herbs and acupuncture could just be what the New Age doctor ordered!|Aries|Libra|Scorpio|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|24|4|This is bound to turn into a silly day if you let it, Cancer. Your best bet is to give in to the strange patterns at work. Communication seems blocked at every turn. You can expect technical difficulties like phone malfunctions or computer crashes. You and your mate will speak in two different languages. No one seems able to get a point across. Don't fight it. Just laugh. All will be normal again tomorrow.|Taurus|Libra|Aquarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|24|5|This isn't a day to make firm commitments, Leo, especially concerning relationships. Today's atmosphere highlights unification and reconciliation, but don't take this as a sign that you're now bound for life. Proceed carefully before making any long-term decisions. If you're about to take a big step at work or in your personal life, try to delay your decision until your thoughts are clearer.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|24|6|You're so upbeat and optimistic by nature that it's difficult for you to accept certain failures. That may be what you're thinking today as you reflect on recent humanitarian efforts. Try not to take such a short-sighted attitude. You're making a difference, even though it may not always be apparent. Continue on this path. Ultimately, you will see how worthwhile the journey is.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|24|7|You're usually very good at concentrating and getting your chores done, even when chaos reigns around you. This likely won't be the case today. Even you will come under the influence of the erratic. It's too hard to get much done with all the commotion. Don't fret about your lack of productivity. This is one day. Relax and have some fun. Tomorrow you can get down to work.|Cancer|Sagittarius|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|24|8|You have strong psychic vision, Scorpio. Some people might say that you're prophetic, but your gift is a combination of creativity and intuition. You can use this to benefit others, and in fact have often done so. You're known for your good advice. Have some restraint today. People are listening closely to what you say. If you advise someone to do something crazy, they might do it!|Cancer|Capricorn|Gemini|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|24|9|The element of water predominates today. You will likely be aware of it by the strong tides of feeling in your household, Sagittarius. Some family members may be unhappy. They may need more independence or look to you for more attention and affection. It's hard to strike the right balance, as you will discover. Do your best to satisfy everyone, making sure that your own needs don't get overlooked.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|24|10|There's a carefree, almost childlike atmosphere to today that suits you just fine, Capricorn. You've been working extraordinarily hard lately and need to relax and unwind a bit. This is a day for doing cartwheels across an open field. You aren't the only one who feels this way - it's positively contagious. Make the most of this wonderful feeling. This is a day for play not work.|Libra|Taurus|Cancer|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|24|11|This is a day for rest and relaxation, Aquarius. Take advantage of the calm atmosphere to center yourself and focus on what's important in your life. You've been going at full speed, and it's possible that your family feels somewhat neglected. Spend some quality time with loved ones. They miss you and will welcome your company. Other concerns come and go, but family is forever.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|24|12|You're on top of the world today, Pisces. Enjoy the view! You're unstoppable. Friends and family alike revel in your good mood. You're materially and spiritually generous, and by day's end people could be lined up to partake of the bounty. Try to curb your enthusiasm and use some discretion. It would be better to give more to a worthy few than give less to many.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|25|1|Forget about work for a change and focus instead on your love life! This is one area that can really use some attention. There's no sense waiting for your partner to do it. It's up to you. Why not book a romantic weekend? It will do wonders for your relationship and add spark just by anticipating the fun you will have. Your commitment should mean more than your independence.|Capricorn|Cancer|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|25|2|You greet the day energized! Your confidence is at an all-time high because of recent events. You have every reason to be proud of what you've accomplished, especially at work. But your love life could benefit from the same level of commitment. Why not be proactive? Arrange a romantic evening for you and your partner. What a difference a few hours can make in your relationship!|Pisces|Virgo|Libra|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|25|3|You have strong humanitarian instincts, Gemini. You think of your fellow humans more than most. This, combined with your intuition and empathy, makes you well suited for the healing professions. If you've felt a bit disgruntled at work lately, it may be that you're in the wrong career. Consider training as a counselor or therapist. You would be good at it and help a lot of people.|Aries|Virgo|Capricorn|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|25|4|You've been more thoughtful lately and more true to yourself. This is due to your recent introspection. You really can change your life. All it takes is time and commitment. You've made great progress in your development. Continue on this path and you will wind up in a much better place. Keep your eye on the goal, but don't be so focused that you forget to enjoy the journey.|Taurus|Scorpio|Capricorn|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|25|5|You're feeling confident and more comfortable in your own skin than you have in a long time, Leo. You're so accomplished, why are you the last one to acknowledge it? Try to look up from your desk long enough to socialize with friends and loved ones. You've been so focused on work that your relationships may have suffered a bit. Spend some quality time with those you care about.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|25|6|It's time to loosen up, Virgo. The planetary aspects bring a new cycle of tolerance and understanding your way. You could use a bit of both. Take baby steps as you introduce the kinder, gentler you to your friends and co-workers. They won't accept a rapid transformation, but they won't mind gradual changes. Listen more and speak less. This can make a big difference in a relationship.|Gemini|Scorpio|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|25|7|Remember all those resolutions you made in the past? It's time to recommit to them. All signs indicate that you need to take better care of yourself. You've been so busy working that exercising has begun to feel like a luxury you can't afford. Actually, exercise and proper nutrition are luxuries you can't afford to ignore. You're burning the candle at both ends. Stop before you burn out completely!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Taurus|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|25|8|This is an auspicious time for you, Scorpio. It gives you the energy and enthusiasm to make the necessary changes in your life. There is a lot of work to do, but you're up to it! First focus on your relationships. Your loved ones don't care about your professional successes. They want (and perhaps need) to spend more time with you. Do what you can to bring your life more into balance.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|25|9|You have tremendous creativity inside you, Sagittarius. Have you begun to use some of it? This creative cycle will last for the next month or so. Don't let it pass without taking advantage of it. Use the other side of your brain for a change. Take up sketching, painting, or fiction writing. What you do is less important than doing something. The simple act of creation unlocks the brain.|Virgo|Aries|Gemini|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|25|10|Get excited, because this is going to be one great day! Everything will go your way. It will seem as if you simply can't lose. At work, team members look to you as the leader. At home, family members express gratitude and affection. You may be tempted to try this luck at the casino, but don't be impulsive. You're already a winner. You've earned this shining moment.|Libra|Aries|Cancer|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|25|11|This is a good day for quiet contemplation, Aquarius. You may have worried about finances lately, but there's no longer any need to concern yourself. All signs indicate that your financial fortunes are about to change. You've been working hard and should reap some rewards. Today's aspects suggest that you will. Enjoy your newfound peace of mind, but don't go out and use the credit cards in celebration!|Libra|Aries|Cancer|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|25|12|Pisces, you're bound to enjoy this day! It's full of possibilities and opportunities. It may begin routinely, but keep your eyes and ears open for hints of change. Your new adventure may come about in a mundane way. You might meet someone in line at the store who becomes a business partner. Or maybe you will meet a romantic interest at the ATM. Adventure is all around. Trust that you will find it!|Sagittarius|Gemini|Leo|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|1|Just when you thought that the whole world was turning on you, Aries, things start to come back around. You will find that you don't need to hide. In fact, the more you let your true spirit emerge, the more allies you will gain. Your secret ambition to rule your world is becoming a much more attainable goal than you might have thought at first.|Aquarius|Leo|Virgo|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|2|The more you let your ego and fantasies swell today, Taurus, the more friction you will encounter. Others aren't going to be fooled, nor are they going to want to deal with frivolity. You might consider letting someone else take the lead while you focus more on your internal energy. Don't be surprised if you cry for no apparent reason. It's important that the tears come out.|Pisces|Leo|Sagittarius|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|3|The hard work and detail-oriented planning you've done lately are really starting to pay off, Gemini. The key is to maintain your sensitivity and look to where you can be of service to others. Your nurturing side feels the need to express itself. Follow your heart today and be respectful of your emotions. The thing you need to be most conscious of is not overextending yourself.|Aries|Libra|Sagittarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|26|4|You may not want to wander far from your bedroom today. That's fine. Take this opportunity to get things done around the house that make you feel like your energy is an important part of the atmosphere. Hang new pictures, read inspiring articles, and laugh at magazine cartoons that inspire your humorous side. Be soft and gentle with your words and actions. Just take it easy!|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|26|5|Things are on the upswing for you today, Leo. People are finally coming around to see things from your perspective. There's no need to doubt yourself. Look in the mirror and know that the person you see is capable of accomplishing anything. Your powerful emotions are your allies. Don't be afraid to let your heart speak up loud and clear the way it wants to.|Taurus|Libra|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|26|6|Take a step back from the line of fire today and examine your position. You've made some bold moves and now it's time to pause and evaluate. Listen to others' reactions. Take the observations and comments to heart. Other people may see things about your situation that you don't. Don't get boxed in by narrow-minded thinking. Digest what you learn and expand your horizons.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aries|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|26|7|You may not feel like you're in tune with your situation today, Libra. Try not to get too pushy with your opinions about how things should be done. Honor other people's perspectives and approaches. It may be hard for others to commit to things the same way you do. Their methods may be different, but that doesn't mean they are necessarily any better or worse.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|8|Try not to be too competitive today, Scorpio. The more you try to drive your point across, the more it will meet stubborn opposition. This is a better day to observe the situation. Emotions are running high, and people aren't necessarily acting rationally. It will do no good to try to reason with someone determined to fight. Save your ammunition for something else.|Leo|Pisces|Taurus|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|9|Sink into a soft, gentle rhythm and you flow with everything around you, Sagittarius. Ease your mind about any worries. Your subconscious knows the way. The key today is sensitivity and intuition - your specialties. You don't need to be concerned about a thing. Everything will work out fine. Don't worry that you haven't prepared enough. Give yourself a break and relax.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|26|10|Now isn't the time to prove to people that you're the boss, Capricorn. They would surely become defensive. You're much better off taking a sensitive, nurturing approach on a day like today. Focus your fire internally and use it to drive your own engine. Don't run over anyone else in the process or try to run their engine for them.|Virgo|Pisces|Gemini|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|26|11|This is a favorable day for you to deal with intimate and sensitive issues, Aquarius. You will be in comfortable situations that allow you to express what you believe. There's no need to hold back, because people will have a greater understanding of what it is you feel. You combine deep emotions with mental clarity and you're able to see through to the truth in other people's words.|Scorpio|Taurus|Cancer|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|26|12|There's a very heavy atmosphere around you that might feel stifling, Pisces. Situations are cropping up that urge you to think practically with regard to your emotions. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you slow down and think about a situation before you proceed. Make sure you consider all the choices and what their effects will be on other people.|Capricorn|Cancer|Leo|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|1|There's a call for you to focus on tangible items today, Aries. Your emotions may be a bit restricted, but you will find comfort in beautiful, luxurious surroundings. Don't be surprised if people are a bit more critical than usual. What they intend as helpful may come across as hurtful. Try to keep a positive spin on things or you may slip down a negative spiral of self-pity.|Aquarius|Cancer|Scorpio|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars
2016|12|27|2|Get your life in order today, Taurus. Take off the mask you've been wearing and look in the mirror. Make sure you like the person you see. This is a good day to put frivolity aside and concentrate on what you need to accomplish. Tend to your duties and plan wisely for the future. Store up your resources instead of squandering them all now.|Pisces|Virgo|Scorpio|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|3|You will fit in perfectly with just about every situation you encounter today, Gemini. Things are going well for you, so take advantage of the energy. You will find that you can accomplish a lot with very little effort. Other people will respect that. If something needs to be done meticulously and efficiently, you're the one for the job.|Pisces|Virgo|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|4|Don't expect a reaction from people today even if you tell the funniest jokes. Others are likely to be reserved and uptight. For the most part, the day's forecast calls for conservative skies and a slight chance of grumpiness. The best way to handle this is to engage in activities that require discipline, grounding, and efficiency. Finish your chores and plan fun things for evening.|Aries|Virgo|Aquarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|27|5|You will keep a level head today, Leo, so take this opportunity to make rational decisions about the most intense issues on the table. Stay grounded and concentrate on what you need to do. Don't get caught up in the usual emotional drama. Restriction and limitation are main themes of the day that will help you reach your goals.|Aries|Libra|Pisces|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|27|6|Your playful attitude will be a welcome addition to the sober, restrictive tone of the day. On the other hand, it may behoove you to be serious in order to accomplish what you need to get done. The choice is up to you. However, you would probably be wise to spend this day taking care of chores and nagging errands that you've put off for quite some time.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|27|7|This is a terrific day for you, Libra. You will feel a greater sense of appreciation and respect for the people around you. The planning and hard work you've contributed recently is finally paying off. People are likely to arrive at your level of thinking. You'll find you can connect on a very productive level. Your emotions are under control and your thoughts crystal clear.|Cancer|Aquarius|Aries|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|27|8|There's a restrictive, sober tone to the day that may wear you down, Scorpio. The trick to working this energy to your advantage is to adjust your game plan to fit the mood. Take care of mundane chores and small obstacles. Make realistic plans and follow through with short-term goals. Water your plants. Do things that require discipline and grounding.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|9|Come down from the clouds today, Sagittarius. It's important to connect with what's going on down here. It could be that you're missing your target because you failed to take certain details into account that are obvious to everyone else. Attend to projects that require your attention. Realistic planning and disciplined actions are the best activities to engage in.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|10|There's a lethargic pace to the day that might leave you frustrated, Capricorn. It may seem as if things aren't progressing as quickly as you'd like. Don't be seduced by the idea that everything needs to get done sooner. Faster isn't necessarily better. Focus on quality and efficiency. Examine what could be considered wasteful action. Streamline your daily routine.|Libra|Aries|Gemini|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|27|11|This is a terrific day for you to accomplish a lot, Aquarius. You may feel restricted in your emotions and unable to make certain deep-level connections, but don't worry about it. If the time doesn't feel right to engage in deep conversation, don't push it. Concentrate on the things that you need to get done personally and professionally.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Cancer|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|27|12|Slow down a bit today and do some planning. There's a steady, grounded mood that will help bring your thoughts and actions down to Earth. The wind may not be filling your sails as much as you'd like, but you can use this to your advantage. The underlying reservation in people's attitudes and opinions will aid you quite a bit. Eliminate the fluff and concentrate on what's real.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|1|What changes have there been in your life since this time last year? Think about the events that have taken place. What have you accomplished? What decisions have you made? And most importantly, how much you have grown as a person? Try to make changes by following your intuition. Even though it seems stressful and sometimes painful, change means growth!|Aquarius|Leo|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|2|"It may be upsetting to you, Taurus, but there's something you need to think about. You should finally get it through your head that the people you often call ""brilliant"" are only reflections of you. If this month you decide to have a little faith in yourself and assert yourself a little, you could be in for some very nice surprises! You'll see!"|Aquarius|Leo|Scorpio|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|3|What a great day for you! You seem to have the innate listening abilities of a therapist or counselor. Everyone comes to you with their problems or to cry on your shoulder. They know that you will listen without judgment. Have you ever thought about doing something like this for a living? Perhaps today will make you think about it.|Pisces|Leo|Capricorn|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|28|4|If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. This is your maxim for the day, Cancer. What have you done lately to improve the way you live your life? Would you consider taking off on some wild adventure without looking back? Today you may meet some people who will make you want to. They're adventurers looking for thrills and chills, with all the risks that come along with them.|Pisces|Virgo|Aquarius|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|28|5|Strength of character will be your partner today, Leo. You seem to have an aura whose intensity scares some people and attracts others. Your force of character could be the cause of some wonderful feelings and emotions for the people close to you. Don't try and hide your emotions. They're the source of your creativity.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|28|6|What an extraordinary day for you, Virgo! The dynamic energy in the air will help you set new personal goals. The positive feedback you get from the people around you could inspire you to make some life-changing decisions for the good of you and your family. Don't hesitate to share the day's positive attitude with them.|Gemini|Capricorn|Pisces|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|28|7|You can start your day without all the usual planning. Be free to discover your day as it unfolds. This might feel like it's against your nature, but it's good for you to enjoy life's sometimes arbitrary nature every once in a while. Otherwise, you may miss out on some of the best things life has to offer!|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|8|In general, you tend to be critical of the way the government and politicians handle social issues and institutions. Your goal isn't just to criticize, however. You would also like to see some positive changes in these areas. The aura of understanding and comprehension in the air today helps you realize that if you want the world to evolve, you're going to have to get people to react.|Cancer|Capricorn|Aries|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|9|Sagittarius, you may have felt as if something has been changing in your family environment over the last few weeks. Today you will find out what's been going on. Someone close to you has been going through some important changes in his or her life. You feel as if you need to be there and accompany this person on a journey of self-development.|Virgo|Pisces|Taurus|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|28|10|You tend to think of yourself as a lone warrior, Capricorn. Today your efforts over the last few weeks pay off. You've found your place in a group of people. You may even call it a family. You now have a place to come home to, whether it's to celebrate your victories or lick your wounds. If you could just open up to other people, you'd soon find that you have more than one safe haven.|Scorpio|Taurus|Gemini|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|11|You love the creative process, Aquarius. Even watering your plants or painting a picture will give you a feeling of joy. If this month you get a chance to finish a project that you really care about, you will be satisfied with the results. And you will be surprised to see people react positively. It's OK to be proud of yourself.|Scorpio|Taurus|Leo|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|28|12|Pisces, your lighthearted attitude has given you a reputation as an eternal teenager. But levity is also a sign of a very wise person, a person who knows how to laugh at their wisdom. Whether you realize it or not, you can get involved in a serious relationship without losing your lightheartedness. If you're already in a committed relationship, you know how true this is.|Capricorn|Cancer|Virgo|3 stars|2 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|29|1|You may come in contact with someone today with whom you enjoy a highly emotional exchange. You may even fall in love! Be very attentive to your moods and everything going on inside you, Aries. They will be particularly strong, and they will help you understand what is changing in you. Just be careful to distinguish your feelings from those of your (future?) partner.|Capricorn|Cancer|Libra|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|29|2|It's possible that you're having some ups and downs in your love life at the moment. Someone may be asking you to play another role than you're used to playing in your relationship. Today, Taurus, you should take the time to think about these pressures on you. You're going to need the answers to these questions over the next few months.|Aquarius|Cancer|Sagittarius|3 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|29|3|Today you may get the opportunity to feel proud of yourself. But don't let things get too out of hand. It isn't often that you allow yourself this little bit of narcissism. Everything you say will be pertinent, and people will let you know. For once, the stars are giving you the opportunity to cater to your own ego, so take advantage of it!|Aquarius|Leo|Capricorn|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|29|4|"Today you may be overcome by a current of humanist thought, Cancer. Your consciousness is traveling, and you probably couldn't care less about the details of the events going on around you. You're freethinking, which is inspired by your spirit of fairness. You may even be in a situation where you have to act as a kind of ""enlightened"" referee, which you will only be too happy to do!"|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|29|5|Even if you're a good judge of character, Leo, the people who know you say that you base your opinions on your personal feelings, which often affect your good judgment. Today your critics are wrong and your judgments are as precise and objective as they can possibly be. They may even help you out of a sticky situation.|Taurus|Sagittarius|Aquarius|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|29|6|You have a tendency to want to explain everything that goes on around you, Virgo. You rationalize everything in an instant, and group all your experiences into great theories.

Today you will get a few words in, so don't worry.|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|4 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|29|7|As a Libra, you don't really like to talk about things. Talking just isn't one of your specialties.

Tell us a little something about how you feel deep inside!|Gemini|Sagittarius|Pisces|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|29|8|Scientists seem to live in a world apart from the rest of us, Scorpio, and from the events in everyday life, because they're so absorbed in other realities. This is a lot like your universe. If you were a scientist, you might do what they sometimes do - make parallels, like those learned men who apply their scientific reasoning to events in the world by analogy. Tell us your theories!|Leo|Aquarius|Aries|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|29|9|You're often like a Zen master who doesn't say anything to pupils for months, until the day the pupils begin to not believe any more and find themselves growing indifferent to the whole thing.

2016|12|29|11|Today is a good day to clarify your life, Aquarius. You may have understood lately that it's useless to undertake anything new when you're confused.

You're in no mood to waste time at the moment.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Virgo|4 stars|2 stars|2 stars|2 stars
2016|12|30|1|You're usually good at bringing people together. Your greatest strength is giving identity to those people who seek it.

2016|12|30|2|Some of you still let individuals from other Zodiac Signs do all the creating for you. The planetary configuration today pushes you to free yourself from the ties that bind you.

2016|12|30|6|Do you help the world evolve, Virgo? You may ask yourself this kind of delicate question today.

Don't get thrown off track by emotional circumstances.|Taurus|Scorpio|Aquarius|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|30|7|You may have a tendency to be overprotective of the people closest to you, especially children.

But the people you're trying to protect are probably better prepared and adapted to the world than you think, Libra. They might try to tell you this even if your support is indispensable.|Cancer|Capricorn|Pisces|3 stars|4 stars|3 stars|4 stars
2016|12|30|8|You probably need society's or other people's approval in order to feel good about yourself, Scorpio. But your original personality and way of thinking are often hard for others to accept. You may need to make your ideas less crazy and a little more down to Earth and practical. This should be your goal over the next few days if you don't want to feel left out of things.|Virgo|Pisces|Aries|2 stars|4 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|30|9|The events of the day depend on your ability to put things into question today, Sagittarius.

2016|12|30|12|Today is an inspirational day for you, fast-thinking Pisces. Let those visions come to you, process them, and try to verbalize them.

Have a notepad handy to jot down all your insights.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Libra|4 stars|4 stars|4 stars|3 stars
2016|12|31|1|It takes two to tango, Aries. Remember that life isn't a one-way street. There needs to be a bit of give and take if you expect others to treat you the way you want to be treated.

Say something meaningful.|Sagittarius|Gemini|Scorpio|3 stars|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars
2016|12|31|2|It may be hard to resolve anything today, Taurus. It could be that there's an overwhelming resistance making it difficult to act according to plan. Today isn't a good day to fight.

2016|12|31|5|You may feel extra self-confident today, Leo, making you more able to say and do the things you might normally keep inside.

Don't let others' disapproval hinder your progress.|Aries|Libra|Capricorn|2 stars|3 stars|3 stars|2 stars
2016|12|31|6|You might find that others' strong opinions dictate today's actions, Virgo. The atmosphere is quite intense, so you might want to lay low and let others have their way.

2016|12|31|7|Create your own reality, Libra. It could be that you have the puppet strings in your hands, but you're too afraid to use them. Don't shy away from responsibility.

Consider your heart as well as your head.|Leo|Aquarius|Taurus|3 stars|3 stars|4 stars|2 stars
2016|12|31|9|Other people may tend to snap under the emotional pressure of the day, Sagittarius, but you're well suited to soar through with flying colors. You're ruled by your emotions and you have no problem navigating rough waters. Other people may look to you for strength and support.

2016|12|31|10|There's a need for decisive action today, Capricorn, and you're the one fit for the job. Strong wills and forceful opinions will win out. Others aren't likely to be easily manipulated.

2016|12|31|11|There may be tension and opposition today, Aquarius, so be prepared. It could seem like everyone wants to rattle your cage. Stand strong.

2016|12|31|12|What ails you now can be eliminated if you're willing to stand up and say exactly what needs to be said, Pisces.
